<PRE>Le 13/09/2010 22:58, Eero Tamminen a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Having an indicator about location &amp; how many lines is visible is nice and
</I>&gt;<i> very good improvement!
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
Thanks,

&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Gem look and feel
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - 17 lines displayed instead of 16 before
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> But I think it's confusing to have file name above folder name.  GEM doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> have that and neither has any of the other OSes I can think of.
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
I agree here. I wanted to remove this file name and gain 2 more lines of 
display.
But how can one knows which file he has selected ?
(I would have to invert backgroud/foreground under mouse selection, 
which means new police ?)
&gt;<i> Having slightly GEMish look for one little part of the file selector doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> match very well with rest of the file selector either.  The look of the
</I>&gt;<i> corner boxes doesn't even match GEM (see attached screenshot)...
</I>It's because I took as model the main GEM window instead of a GEM 
fileSelector.
I can remove the upper right icon (which is not useful).
&gt;<i> It looks even worse with no zooming (when you start Hatari with &quot;-z 1&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>I didn't test it. I'll have a look

&gt;<i> -&gt;  I suggest keeping the folder name above the file name like GEM has it.
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
I can also return to previous Fileselector display if you want and just 
keep the scrollbar.
I found nicer to have a better look for the scrollbar, but the only 
interesting change in my code is the scrollbar function.
I also managed to gain 2 more display lines with this new look (path 
folders in the upper part of the selector)

Just tell me if you prefer the older look.

&gt;&gt;<i> - upper left button for &quot;..&quot; folder
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Still to do :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - allow to scroll the scrollbar with the mouse (for now, it just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> displays the current view of browsed files)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> One can already do that with scrollwheel which is OK if the list of files
</I>&gt;<i> isn't huge.  But being able to grab the bar and drag would indeed be nice.
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>I work on it (but it doesn't react as I would like for now)

&gt;<i> As to up&amp;  down key repeat, I'd just ignore that.  To use the file selector
</I>&gt;<i> one already needs to use mouse.  Having draggable bar in scrollbar would
</I>&gt;<i> be much more useful.
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>Ok, I forget this point.

&gt;<i> (for longer scrolls, page up&amp;  down functionality compensates slightly for
</I>&gt;<i> up&amp;  down keys not repeating.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Question :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Do you like it ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Can I remove the old &quot;..&quot; button, as now, you can  move to upper
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> folder with the upper left corner button ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>      
</I>&gt;<i> It's still useful and you anyway need the other buttons.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe it's better at the left upper corner instead of the right one?
</I>&gt;<i>    
</I>
?? it is already at the upper left corner ?
(I agree, I should remove the upper right icon which is not usefuil at all)


Regards,

Laurent
