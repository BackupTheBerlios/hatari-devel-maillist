<PRE>Hi,

Is there anobody else both using Hatari on OSX and who can replicate
this crash?  Jerome?

The non-standard Hatari GUIs (like the OSX specific one and my Python/Gtk
specific one) of course aren't dependent on the SDL UI.

It's also _much_ easier to do things in them as they aren't constrained to
the Hatari window size, they have many more widgets, the widgets and 
containers resize themselves automatically (SDL GUI widgets are even
more primitive than GEM ones) etc.

Thanks!  That looks pretty good. :-)

It's basically a tabbed interface with tab scrolling done a bit
unconventionally (usually arrows for scrolling tabs are at the tab
row/column ends, but in your design they would take more space and with this
many items, having tabs at top would've been less useful so your design is
better).

Usability:
+ Needing one click less to back out from settings is an improvement.
- The UI is a bit more crowded so it might be a bit harder to hit
  the buttons (e.g. on 3.5&quot;/266 DPI touchscreen one of Hatari devices has).

Looks:
- With the settings always filling the whole sreen, some of the views will
  be very full, some less so (e.g. ROM settings).  This may look a bit
  unbalanced.  Would need design for all the views to comment more
  on this.

Implementation issues:
- Need to do large changes to implementations of *all* view to take into
  account the new looks.  There's currently no support for subviews in
  neither the code for showing of the UI or interpreting the user actions on
  one.
- The top level menu handling needs to be rewritten so that it's done in all
  the subviews (e.g. through helper function and returning what was
  clicked).
- SDL UI doesn't currently provide a scrolled list widget, so implementing
  the tabs list is also a bit more work than one might assume.


I've thought that I could change the Python/Gtk UI to use a tabbed interface
for settings too, but I'm a bit undecided on whether I should split HW
options that require reboot from the non-reboot HW options (like floppy)
and from emulator options (like scaling).

Could somebody post screenshots of what the all OSX UI tabs look like?

Hatari screenshots page has only few of them and I think they're out of
date:
