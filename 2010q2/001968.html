For call graphs you need either the whole instruction flow (which is already
provided by CPU disassembly), not a profile, or somehow taking the backtrace
now and then (maybe by tracking instruction branches and returns).

Both are pretty huge things wheas what I did is pretty simple/small
(only complication comes from optimizing memory usage &amp; speed for CPU side).


Btw. Profile may sometimes be nice in debugging things too, because trace
gives too much information.  Just add symbols for the functions you're
interested about and check whether they get hits in profile.

Think e.g. about debugging programs running in EmuTOS/TeraDesk/XaAES/MiNT 
environment.  Hatari provides an environment which has better HW emulation
than Aranym (except for MMU emulation...), so it could be better for
debugging certain category of issues with those.  Might be useful e.g.
for the ColdFire stuff development.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (and with what users would like to do with these).

</I>
I was thinking more of demos with subroutines for e.g. handling 3d.
You could e.g. compare routines when viewing different objects, or
using different view angles.

You get really accurate results when using breakpoints to stop the 
profiling.

Tob&#233;, did you have some particular use-case in mind for profiling?


&gt;<i> &gt; While on cycle accuracy, how do I get the information about how many
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; cycles the previous instruction used?  For CPU?  For DSP?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In m68k_run_1(), &quot;cycles&quot; contains the result for the last opcode. In
</I>&gt;<i> case some special processing should be made, there's already the code

</I>&gt;<i>          if (regs.spcflags) {
</I>&gt;<i>              if (do_specialties ())
</I>&gt;<i>                  return;
</I>&gt;<i>          }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In that case, we could modify do_specialties() to take &quot;int cycles&quot; as an
</I>&gt;<i> argument, and put some redirection to profiling code in do_specialties().
</I>
What about the global CurrentInstrCycles variable value?

Couldn't I just compare its value?

Or maybe use Cycles_GetCounter(CYCLES_COUNTER_CPU)?


Laurent, what about DSP cycles, can those be gotten from somewhere?


&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I'm currently assuming (to save memory) that CPU and DSP
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instructions can never be on odd addresses.  Is that correct?
</I>
Preliminary code for profiling both DSP and CPU code is attached.
