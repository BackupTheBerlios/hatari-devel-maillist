If I see correctly, your profile shows Hatari using 23% of CPU and Mach 
kernel using 63% of CPU.  Latter is *huge*.   Could you mail also what
the heck your kernel does?


So, you have zooming, borders enabled, the screen requires spec512 mode and
your screen is running in 32-bit mode.  This is heaviest screen processing
one can get out of Hatari.

One possible issue with 32-bit could be that maybe OSX SDL for some reason
forwards the data as having 8-bit alpha channel in addition to 24-bit RGB
data and underlying OSX layers then:
- creates an alpha mask from it on every frame
- needs to blend the updates instead of just blitting them
Both quite heavy extra operations.


I quickly checked SDL (v1.2.13) OSX backed sources and there indeed was
something very suspicious:
-------------------------
/*
    This function makes the *SDL region* of the window 100% opaque.
    The genie effect uses the alpha component. Otherwise,
    it doesn't seem to matter what value it has.
*/
static void QZ_SetPortAlphaOpaque () {

    SDL_Surface *surface = current_video-&gt;screen;
    int bpp;

    bpp = surface-&gt;format-&gt;BitsPerPixel;

    if (bpp == 32) {

        Uint32    *pixels = (Uint32*) surface-&gt;pixels;
        Uint32    rowPixels = surface-&gt;pitch / 4;
        Uint32    i, j;

        for (i = 0; i &lt; surface-&gt;h; i++)
            for (j = 0; j &lt; surface-&gt;w; j++) {

                pixels[ (i * rowPixels) + j ] |= 0xFF000000;
            }
    }
}
-----------------------
This is called from many places in the code.

I.e. the SDL window actually has an *active* alpha mask.  If Qartz doesn't
provide an API to set window as Opaque so OSX can ignore its alpha-channel,
that's a bug in Quartz.  If there is such an API, then not using it is
an SDL bug.

Either of them would be pretty obvious performance bug (just not in Hatari).
Please file a bug into appropriate upstream bug tracker.


There's one thing you could still try.  Does using &quot;--bpp 16&quot; make the 
performance better or worse?  Does the bottleneck reported by Shark
change with it?

Hm. It may actually be better to profile the whole thing... :-)
