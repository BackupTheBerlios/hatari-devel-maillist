Great, thanks!

I'll probably put the debugger tests eventually to its own subdirectory
under tests/.  I think the top directory could just have subdirs for
different test things, some of them intended to be run on the host, some
on the emulated Atari.

I assume the problem I had with CMake was due to the older version that
Debian stable has.  But I wouldn't like to build newer version from sources
though, now I can work as a guinea-pig for issues that other Debian stable
users might encounter when building Hatari with Debian's default CMake. :-)

I'm still hopeful that new Debian stable release comes still this year, and
that the CMake version in Debian testing (currently v2.8.1 which is latest
upstream release) is less buggy than the v2.6.0 I have in current Debian
stable...
