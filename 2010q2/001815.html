Hello,

I agree with the approach where data should be copied during the vbl, else 
you might loose some data if end-start is smaller than the number of 
sample per vbl (as determined by the dma freq).

In fact, there's a similar need in ym2149 : volumes can be modulated (to 
play sample or simulate sid effect). In that case, the current ym buffer 
for the vbl is updated each time a write is made to an ym register. So if 
there're only change every vbl, we build the ym sound buffer at the end of 
the vbl, else the sound buffer is partially updated each time a register 
is modified.

What I fear if you use a timer, is that it will take quite more cpu cycle 
by always using a timer (which is quite costy in cycint.c), even in some 
situation where it's not needed.
So, I think there should be at least 2 cases :

  1) dma_end - dma_start &gt; sample per vbl : in that case, you don't need an 
internal timer, you can just copy ( dma_current - dma_start ) samples at 
the end of the vbl and add these samples to the current sound buffer.

  2) dma_end - dma_start &lt; sample per vbl : in that case, you could use a 
timer that triggers after the equivalent of ( dma_end - dma_start ) 
samples were supposed to be processed by the dma (taking dma freq into 
account). Extreme case is of course when dma_end - dma_start = 2 and in 
that case timer will be started at the equivalent of dma freq.


Most demos/games are using case 1) : dma samples are computed for the next 
vbl and played in one go (else this would need some mfp/dma interrupt on 
STE to &quot;refill&quot; the dma, which is not the simplest way to play sound). So, 
we should keep a case that handle this with as little cpu penalty as 
possible.

In the case of 2), I think a way to avoid a timer could be to detect if 
some write accesses are made to the ram between dma_start and dma_end.

Here, I see 2 cases also :
  - If no write are made, then you can copy at the end of the vbl as many 
time as needed the bytes in ram between dma_start and dma_end (since this 
area was not written to, there's no risk that some sound values will be 
overwritten by others)

  - each time a write is made : fill hatari's output sound buffer up to the 
point where the write was made. This should take into account the dma 
freq. If another write is made, determine how many cpu cycles elapsed 
since the last sound buffer's update and depending on this determine how 
many bytes should be added to the sound buffer. These bytes will the one 
between dma_prev_addr and dma_cur_addr, &quot;resampled&quot; to hatari's output 
freq.

In fact, if we want to be accurate, case 2) should always be used instead 
of case 1), because even if we know &quot;dma_end - dma_start &gt; sample per 
vbl&quot;, this doesn't mean that the cpu is not writing to this dma area 
*while* the sound is played.

This is a much more complicated method, but I think it's the most accurate 
one and would not be that costly, because in the end the demo/game will 
certainly only write ~1000 samples per vbl (at 50 kHz), which means the 
&quot;update dma sound buffer&quot; would be called 1000 times (which is not that 
much when compared to some STF demo that plays 15 or 20 Khz samples).

In the end, this method is even very close to the one used for ym2149 :
  - in ym2149, update the sound buffer each time an ym reg between 0 and 13 
is modified (and complete the buffer at the end of the vbl)

  - in dma mode, update the sound buffer each time the memory is modified 
between dma_start and dma_end (and complete the buffer at the end of the 
vbl)


Well, as I type this long mail, I agree that using a timer in cycint.c 
running at the current dma freq timer might be a simpler solution to 
implement, and it would work with cases 1) and 2) too.
Let's ignore what I wrote above :)

But I don't really agree cycint.c timers are not precise enough : we can 
have a timer every 4 cpu cycles, which is 2 Mhz, so this should be enough 
to simulate a 50 Khz dma freq, even if this is not an integer multiple.

So, maybe the noisy sound is due to a precision/rounding problem in the 
interrupt handler for the dma sound (from an electronic point of view, 
even the ste has the same primary clock that is divided to give the cpu or 
the dma sound clock, and the sound is ok).
