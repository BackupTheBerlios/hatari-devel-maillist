Changing them should trigger some recompile ... because the
corresponding define is now passed via the config.h file and not via
the CFLAGS anymore. And when config.h is changed, the files that
include this file should be rebuilt, too. Doesn't this work for you?

Such a thing never happened for me with CMake yet... also not with your
patch that I've just tried... Sounds like the CMake version in Debian
stable is really very old and buggy :-(

Maybe you could install CMake 2.8 in /opt/cmake or so, just to have a
reference CMake that might work better?

&gt;<i> Thomas, could you try the attached CMakeLists.txt file patch and tell
</I>&gt;<i> why it doesn't work properly?
</I>
According to the file CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log that my CMake (2.8)
produced, it did not like your mudflap test because it did not link
against libmudflap during the test. The following sequence fixed this
problem for me:

set(CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES &quot;mudflap&quot;)
CHECK_C_COMPILER_FLAG(&quot;-fmudflapth&quot; MUDFLAP_AVAILABLE)
set(CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES &quot;&quot;)

After that, CMake correctly detected that mudflap is available:

-- Performing Test MUDFLAP_AVAILABLE
-- Performing Test MUDFLAP_AVAILABLE - Success


&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I had the documentation on the Mudflap usage in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Makefile-default.cnf (as it was developers only and I couldn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think of a better place), I guess something similar to this can now
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be put to the main CMakefile?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The attached patch does also this.
</I>
Ok, looks good, please commit if the CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES fix is
working for you, too!

&gt;<i> [1] These are the commands from the shell history that I run in
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;build&quot; subdirectory (I removed the results between every call as
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise it uses the cached values) before the mess:
</I>&gt;<i> cmake ..
</I>&gt;<i> cmake -Wdev
</I>&gt;<i> cmake -Wdev ..
</I>&gt;<i> cmake .. -Wdev
</I>&gt;<i> cmake --graphviz=dep.dot --system-information=sys.txt
</I>&gt;<i> --debug-trycompile --debug-output .. cmake --system-information
</I>&gt;<i> sys.txt --debug-trycompile --debug-output .. cmake --debug-trycompile
</I>&gt;<i> --debug-output ..
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you're wondering what I was doing:
</I>&gt;<i> * man page listed -Wdev option, but it wasn't accepted by CMake
</I>
Works with CMake 2.8, but I did not see any significant difference to a
normal run.

&gt;<i> Btw. the --graphviz output is quite useless, it lists only deps to
</I>&gt;<i> libs, not to source files...
</I>
Yes, that seems to be quite useless - it's still the same in CMake 2.8.
