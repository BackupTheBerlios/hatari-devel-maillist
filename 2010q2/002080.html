I don't know what happens (well, from hatari's code I think it will add 
'len' bytes of delay on each delayed callback), but I don't think Hatari 
has to handle this.

Such problems should be handled by SDL / the OS / the sound driver, but 
not by hatari, we can't complexify the code to take care of all the setups
users can have (and their potential bugs).

For example, in your case, I'm quite convinced the alsa driver for your 
sound car is either broken or incomplete.
I don't know when next version of centos is supposed to be released, but 
maybe with a more up to date combiantion of kernel/alsa/sdl you wouldn't 
get those problems.

In the end, playing sound at 44 kHz or 11 kHz is a really trivial task for 
an OS and Hatari's code should assume that it's working (as long as we 
correctly configure SDL, which seems to be the case), Hatari should not 
have to measure some possible drifts and try to compensate.

If you choose 'output wav file', the wav file will be correct when you 
listen to it, so for me this validates Hatari's sound.

For the next days of rain, you could try centos 5.4 (if that's not your 
current version) or the next 5.5 that's supposed to be released soon :)
