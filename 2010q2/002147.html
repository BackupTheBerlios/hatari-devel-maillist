Basically 3D HW / OpenGL helps with performance only in the cases where
you're dealing with lots &amp; complex geometry and where your texture content
is static.  If all you use it for is pushing constantly updating texture
content and basically no geometry, it can be even slower than using CPU
for that.

E.g. in Omap3, doing something like memcpy with the 3D HW gives you maybe
1/5 of performance of doing it with CPU.  This is because it's running at
1/5 speed while using the same memory as CPU (and neither that nor AFAIK x86
provide cache coherency between CPU and GPU i.e. control transfer implies
a cache flush).  If you can do it asynchronously to the CPU and your CPU is
otherwise fully occupied, you may still get some performance advantage on
shared memory systems, but if you have a discrete graphics card, this
depends on how much slower your HW interface (PCI/AGP/PCI-E) to the graphics
card is compared to your RAM.

</I>
No, the difference concerns fixed functions, but that is really a difference
between focus in OpenGL v1.x and later OpenGL versions, it's nothing
specific to ES subset of the OpenGL API.

Newer full OpenGL API is actually closer to ES API than v1.x API.

The issue I'm after, is that although the full OpenGL API is backwards
compatible to earlier OpenGL versions (e.g. through software fallbacks),
the v2.x ES subset of the OpenGL API drops support for the fixed function
APIs from v1.x.

&gt;<i> Sure, its nicer 
</I>&gt;<i> to program, but not really useful for us OS X users. However, I dont
</I>&gt;<i> see any reason not to support ES in addition - it would just be an
</I>&gt;<i> entirely different codepath. The one does not exclude the other...
</I>
What I'm suggesting is avoiding v1.x OpenGL specific API and using
the ES *subset* of OpenGL 2.x API, not the ES extensions.
