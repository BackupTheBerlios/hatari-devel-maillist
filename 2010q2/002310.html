<PRE>Hi,

Hm.  DSP and other things are just options.  changing them should also
trigger at least some rebuilding...


&gt;<i> Option for this build type should be enabled only if:
</I>&gt;<i> * a new enough GCC version is available (at least 4.x)
</I>&gt;<i> * build target is x86 (AFAIK mudflap works currently only for x86)
</I>
It's also available for other architectures, but I've read some mails that
it works currently properly only for x86, at least in GCC 4.3 or earlier.

Maybe the x86 &amp; GCC check could be skipped and Mudflap check is enough
though.  At least the Mudflap header with its functions should be visible
only when new enough GCC is used (see below).


&gt;<i> * libmudflap dev package is installed
</I>
At least in the Debian, these packages contain mf-runtime.h which provides
the __mf_register() &amp; __mf_unregister() functions (that I used in couple of
suitable places in Hatari code).

That header is not in the normal include paths (it's in the GCC's own) and
there's no pkg-config file for it.  But this include gets included
automatically by GCC when one specifies the -fmudflapth / -fmudflap GCC
option.

I googled a bit and found out that Autotools using programs just check
whether the compiler accepts mudflap compiler option.  That seems like an OK
check for whether to offer users Mudflap option. The attached patch tries to
do something similar.


However, when I tried to debug[1] CMake problem of why it doesn't work
correctly when invoked normally (doesn't find mudflap), but works fine
(finds mudflap) when I ask it to produce debug output, it screwed up
the permissions of all the files under my Hatari directory.

Attached is the result.  I'd rather keep my distance from tools that work 
this badly.

Thomas, could you try the attached CMakeLists.txt file patch and tell why it
doesn't work properly?


&gt;<i> Also, I had the documentation on the Mudflap usage in
</I>&gt;<i> Makefile-default.cnf (as it was developers only and I couldn't think of a
</I>&gt;<i> better place), I guess something similar to this can now be put to the
</I>&gt;<i> main CMakefile?
</I>
The attached patch does also this.

[1] These are the commands from the shell history that I run in &quot;build&quot;
subdirectory (I removed the results between every call as otherwise it uses
the cached values) before the mess:
cmake ..
cmake -Wdev
cmake -Wdev ..
cmake .. -Wdev
cmake --graphviz=dep.dot --system-information=sys.txt --debug-trycompile --debug-output ..
cmake --system-information sys.txt --debug-trycompile --debug-output ..
cmake --debug-trycompile --debug-output ..

If you're wondering what I was doing:
* man page listed -Wdev option, but it wasn't accepted by CMake
* --graphviz value was listed as needing '=', but --system-information not.
So I was kind of wondering whether there are bugs in the manual page &amp; which
way to give values is correct, or is CMake just inconsistent in addition to
buggy.

Btw. the --graphviz output is quite useless, it lists only deps to libs, not
to source files...
