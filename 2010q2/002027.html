<PRE>Hi,

On Sunday 09 May 2010, Laurent Sallafranque wrote:
&gt;<i> I would enjoy to have a list of &quot;parametred working computers&quot; in

</I>
I think easiest would be to make the save &amp; load config buttons to
show a file selector like the memory snapshot save &amp; restore buttons do.

Hatari (python/Gtk) UI already does this.  Just use the &quot;load config...&quot; and
&quot;save config as...&quot; options from its Configuration menu.


&gt;<i> Like this, I would easily choose between a ste and a Falcon at boot and

</I>
With current Hatari you can already do this, just:
- save a suitable configuration &amp; memory states to disk
- copy them under suitable name (say falcon.sav &amp; falcon.cfg)
- set config file to load that memory state automatically (&amp; autosave it)
- create to your desktop shortcut icons which tell Hatari to load these
  configurations.  E.g. &quot;Falcon&quot; shortcut would just start Hatari like this:
	hatari --config &lt;path&gt;/falcon.cfg


&gt;<i> I also find the GUI not really beautiful.
</I>
Aranym one looks better and is AFAIK related somehow to Hatari's GUI code.
Maybe somebody could check whether the nicer looks for buttons etc.
could be brought to Hatari GUI?


&gt;<i> If I had a few hours to loose, would you enjoy a rewrite of this GUI
</I>&gt;<i> menu with a more user friendly interface ?
</I>
The SDL GUI is not really that fun to modify.  Position of everything are /
currently need to be hard coded which means that if you add something, you
need to change also everything else below it (and maybe adapt sizes of
surrounding boxes too).

Additionally, it doesn't handle non-ASCII file names, isn't localizable,
doesn't scale with GUI contents etc.  These are some of the reasons why
I wrote the Hatari UI and why it's included with Hatari...


&gt;<i> Le 09/05/2010 20:23, Eero Tamminen a &#233;crit :
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Note that currently MHz value isn't changed at all because TOSes work

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But if TOS version and other parameters don't match, wouldn't it be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fair to assume that user did a mistake and just forgot to specify other
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; parameters beside TOS?  If yes, then I think it would make sense to set
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; also the MHz to most appropriate value for that TOS, right?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I.e. if one gives e.g. a TT tos, it would be nice if Hatari would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; automatically set speed also for TT without needing to specify
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;--machine tt&quot; or &quot;--cpuclock 32&quot; (or do similar thing in the options
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; GUI)...
</I>
Any comments on this?
