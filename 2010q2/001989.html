Have you tried Hatari (Python+Gtk) UI[1], included and installed with
the rest of the Hatari?

Or are you stuck to Windows?  (The GUI requires socket to Hatari and
although SDL sources indicate that window embedding might be possible also
on Windows, so far Hatari window embedding supports only X.)


[1] I have a screenshot here:

&gt;<i> Hatari default mouse behaviour (ungrabbed and unsynced) is very annoying.
</I>
Grabbing a mouse is quite user unfriendly when (a new) user doesn't
know how to disable it or even exit Hatari...  If this is an issue, I'd
recommend running Hatari in fullscreen unless you need the debugger.

We could consider adding a config file option for mouse grabbing so that you
don't need to specifically toggle it everytime with keyboard or command line
option.  (Then the command line option needs to take a boolean argument
so that grabbing can be turned off from the command line.)

As to unsynched mouse cursor, I think that's mainly(?) a problem with
Falcon, and I don't think Steem is any better there (the issue comes from
Falcon's multiple resolution changes at bootup). :-)


&gt;<i> Steem has very intuitive memory snapshots accessible from the toolbar.
</I>
Hatari UI allows selecting the memory snapshot with a normal Gtk
file selector for loading, there's a menu entry for saving one (to default
location) and for changing the snapshot default location.


&gt;<i> Hatari has nice features, but hidden under obscure keystrokes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are the main points.
</I>&gt;<i> If I had to choose, I would say the biggest issue is the sound delay. I
</I>&gt;<i> love to hear keyclicks on key down. Probably one of the best oldschool

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, Steem is a closed software, not updated anymore, thus sentenced
</I>&gt;<i> to death. How sad for such a good piece of software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the other side, Hatari is Free Software, portable, and has more and
</I>&gt;<i> more features, and is becoming more and more accurate, including Falcon
</I>&gt;<i> hardware. So Hatari will live forever, and will always become better and
</I>&gt;<i> better.
