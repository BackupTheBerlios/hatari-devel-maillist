Hello,

regarding &quot;long long&quot; I agree they may not be native on all architectures, 
but they're at the core of cycInt.c, and CycInt_SetNewInterrupt is called 
much more often than log could be, so that shouldn't be noticeable.

I don't think we will need more than 64 different log levels. We already 
added logs in all parts, we need a few more for the DSP and maybe some 
others here and there, but we shouldn't need more than 32 new ones.
64 should be a limit we can manage.

We should have a method :
  - which is fast to test (so we don't get too much penalty when debug code 
is enabled at compile time)

  - which doesn't require to change the existing LOG calls in all the 
sources.

I'm not sure we require such a level of detail to split log macros between 
video, sound, ...

Current code basically does :
 	if (LogTraceFlags &amp; level)
 		{ print ... }

new possible methods :

  1) set LogTraceFlags to Uint64 -&gt; nothing else to change, we now have 64
     bits to play with and the test remains fast (apart from dealing with
     64 bits int)

  2) have a global variable LogTraceOn = true or false and some additional
     Uint32 to store flags (LogTraceFlags1, LogTraceFlags2, ...)

with 2), code could become :
 	if ( LogTraceOn )
 	{
 		if ( level matches LogTraceFlags1 level
 			|| level matches LogTraceFlags2 )
 			{ print ... }
 	}

problem is : how do we compare *rapidly* the value of level with several 
LogTraceFlagsX variables ?


I would go for 1st solution, as it requires nearly no changes ; or any 
other solution that doesn't require to modify all the sources files that 
have LOG_TRACE calls (only modifications should go to log.c / log.h) as 
this would come to commit nearly the whole source tree, which is quite 
overkill and not really readable.
