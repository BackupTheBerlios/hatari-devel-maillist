<PRE>Hi,

</I>
Dropping a build system is a bit larger change compared to feature
additions, especially when I have posted patches detailing them, asked 
opinion on adding them and others had agreed to them (they don't affect
greatly to what others do).


&gt;<i> Honestly, if we need to release a bug fix release 1.4.1, we should do
</I>&gt;<i> it on a branch from the 1.4.0 release, not from the hg tip.
</I>
If there are tested &amp; already working new features, I don't see why they
couldn't be included to the release to get wider testing for them, if that
doesn't need too much effort.  I think that the profiling thing could be
quite interesting to Hatari users, it's quite isolated and can still be
easily merged to a bugfix branch.

(Removing the (other) v1.4 build system complicates things like that to some
extent (like other larger changes) without adding any extra value.)


&gt;<i> &gt; didn't add all the stuff that was in the Makefiles into CMake files.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For example following things are now missing:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Building &amp; running of the tests
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Support for Mudflap (GCC pointer debugging), both for Hatari itself
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   and the tests (tests don't use external libraries, so they can use
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   additional mudflap options)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's your stuff only, so I leave it up to you to add it to the CMake
</I>&gt;<i> files.
</I>
How / why?

Test stuff is developer-only and contains Linux specific things like
running the tests under Valgrind (which is Linux only), so I think it's
fine to have a normal GNU Makefile there.

As to Mudflap debugging support, I have no idea how to add support
to it to CMake, I need your help there.


&gt;<i> &gt; Please add those or restore the Makefiles.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or what?
</I>
Well, it's a bit unfair to remove &amp; break other's code without a warning.
I think I'm entitled to cry &quot;foul&quot;.  :-)


&gt;<i> Sorry, no, we've really got to get rid of this double maintenance.
</I>&gt;<i> There's no point in keeping two build systems forever. 
</I>
IMHO good point for that would have been before next major release or when
the Makefile stuff started lagging too much behind CMake stuff.  But what's
done is done...
