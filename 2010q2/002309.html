<PRE>Hi,

While Valgrind is a great tool, for emulators like Hatari it's not as useful
as for normal programs.  Valgrind wraps syscalls and allocation related
functions and tracks whether memory going to these wrapped functions is
already free, or not allocated or initialized.

Emulators are &quot;just&quot; large state machines dealing with structures so
Hatari's emulation part itself doesn't do dynamic allocations and very
little syscalls.  Even the SDL GUI uses very few allocs.

That's why I added Mudflap support to Hatari.  It can catch things that
Valgrind cannot i.e. stack and local or static array bounds overwrites
which can potentially happen in many more places in Hatari code than
issues with dynamically allocated or uninitialized memory.

(For performance reasons Mudflap doesn't check everything so it also can
miss some things and there's nothing that catches wrong values put to the
arrays. :-))


Because debugger uses dynamic allocations, I added both valgrind &amp; mudflap
checks to its functionality tests.


&gt;<i> As for the gui, I'm not sure it's the cause of many 
</I>&gt;<i> problem today related to bad memory management / allocation.
</I>
Well, the Hatari OSX version has crashes only when the OSX GUI is used, so
maybe it could profit from some Valgrinding...
