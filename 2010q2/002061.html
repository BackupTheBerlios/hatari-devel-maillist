Hi,

this only happens in windowed mode. In Fullscreen it seems to work better. 
Just like Hatari in general, the windowed mode on OS X is really, really, 
really slow. But we've been over this a thousand times already.

Here's a little video showing the HUD in action:

<A HREF="http://ae.dhs.nu/tmp/hatari_hud.mp4">http://ae.dhs.nu/tmp/hatari_hud.mp4</A>


&gt;<i> If this slowdown happens only on fullscreen, could you try removing
</I>&gt;<i> the HWSURFACE option from screen.c sdlVideoFlags and see whether
</I>&gt;<i> it changes anything?
</I>
No difference (in windowed mode where it happens), it doesn't allow me to 
go to fullscreen mode with this set.



&gt;<i> Because Falcon &amp; TT screen updates work differently (everything is
</I>&gt;<i> updated everytime), step 1) is skipped there.  Do you see less slowdown
</I>&gt;<i> there?
</I>
I don't know how to test this, do you have an idea of a Falcon program 
using the floppy while for example playing music?


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Use &quot;--statusbar off&quot;[1], or set bShowDriveLed in configuration file to
</I>&gt;<i> FALSE.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I had it for a while in the Hatari SDL GUI too, but had to remove it to make
</I>&gt;<i> space for other options.  Attached is a patch to have it back, but it makes
</I>&gt;<i> the screen dialog look a bit off-balance and it would need the HTML manual
</I>&gt;<i> update too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Python/Gtk Hatari GUI of course has an option for this in its UI.
</I>
But nobody seems to use this GTK thing and on Windows there's only the SDL 
one and the OS X GUI seems to lag behind all the time, and as Jerome said, 
his OS X updates does not seem to get submitted.

Anyway thanks for the patch, any chance this could come to the repo as 
well? When I do patches myself I always end up in conflicts with the repo 
:<i>)
</I>


&gt;<i> If you have specific configuration between which you'd like to use, IMHO
</I>&gt;<i> easiest way is to add shortcuts to your desktop which tell Hatari which
</I>&gt;<i> config file to use (with &quot;--configfile &lt;file&gt;&quot; option).
</I>
That would open a terminal window as it involves doing a script, which is 
why I use the custom made application instead.

To have this in the drop down menu bar would be ideal.



&gt;<i> Attached is mostly untested patch for adding question on whether the (last)
</I>&gt;<i> succesfully created disk image should be inserted to drive A:. I think
</I>&gt;<i> drive B: is too rare case to worry about (and it would need creating a new
</I>&gt;<i> dialog).
</I>
Thanks for this patch, I hope it goes into the repo as well :) However 
having an alert with three options should be doable?

Mount A:  | Mount B:  |&#160;Don't mount


&gt;&gt;<i> 4. Then we have the usual long-term request of using the current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resolution and refreshrate instead of changing it when going to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fullscreen.
</I>&gt;<i> Resolution thing should already work for Falcon &amp; TT screens?
</I>&gt;<i> They use completely different code from ST/STE.
</I>
I don't see how TT/Falcon mode would not alter refresh rate in fullscreen? 
The resolution definitly changes to something else than my native res.


&gt;<i> Hatari doesn't have any control over refresh rate or how fullscreening
</I>&gt;<i> is implemented, only what what window/screen size it would like to have.
</I>&gt;<i> Rest is (intentionally) hidden by SDL.
</I>
Yes, that's why the technicque of changing resolution is flawed to begin 
with. Fullscreen should use the _current_ resolution without any change 
and scale the graphics accordingly. All comptuers made the last decade or 
so have hardware scaling support, and older machines than that are too 
slow for Hatari anyways. Apart from the hwardware scaling, a modern 
compter can do software scaling without a blink as well.

See the Vice emulator as a great example how things can be implemented.



&gt;<i> You could try whether removing HWSURFACE option from screen.c has
</I>&gt;<i> any effect on this.  If it has, we could consider making it optional.
</I>
This wouldn't even let me go to fullscreen at all.
