Hello,

I don't think this is needed in our case, because the emulation will 
buffer 1 VBL of sound at a time anyway.

On a real hardware, you need a 2 cycles &quot;precision&quot; because each sample 
must be sent to the DAC immediatly to get a continuous sound.

But when emulating (whether it's ym or dma samples), you don't need to 
output samples 1 or 2 bytes at a time in real time, you always buffer 
everything for a whole VBL before sending this buffer to SDL's audio 
stack. So, if you require a 60 cycles timer and this timer is delayed 
sometimes, then it's up to your timer code to take this delay into account 
to compensate it.

The timers in cycint.c will never happen before cycles are elapsed, they 
will trigger in 2 cases :
  - no delay due to cpu instruction, you get an exact precision of 60 
cycles.
  - timer is delayed, let's say for 12 cycles. So your timer expired at 72 
cycles instead of 60.

For the 2nd case, if you look at video.c, some similar cases are handled 
for VBL/HBL by using &quot;PendingCyclesOver&quot;. This value is always &gt;= 0.
When it's 0, you're in the first (easy) case.
Here we would get PendingCyclesOver=12, which means you should not output 
a sample corresponding to &quot;now&quot; but to &quot;now - 12 cycles&quot; (depending on the 
sound freq, this could mean 2 or 3 samples earlier for example).

With PendingCyclesOver, I'm pretty sure it's possible to get a continuous 
sound and to compensate for the fact that the timer is delayed with the 
current hatari's architecture. The method is a little trickier than if you 
had exact 60 cycles precision, but in the end this comes to incrementing a 
float index and to round it to the lower or upper integer.

Also, 60 cpu cycles is quite a lot for a falcon, as a 68020+ will mostly 
have some ~12 cycles or so instructions, so delay will often be less than 
that. Of course not taking this delay into account would be wrong, but 
once you handle it you will see it doesn't affect sound that much (but not 
emulating this &quot;that much delay&quot; can make the whole difference and cause a 
bad sound).
