Thanks, these show already something useful!

Couple of extra questions:

* Did you have borders enabled?  (I guess yes)
* Did you profile just the running of  the demo or also Hatari startup?
* Does Shark profile include only information on the running process
  or also the other processes + OSX kernel?


Top 5 bottlenecks on 1x zoom are:
- 7.6%, m68k_go, Hatari
- 7.4%, ConvertSpec512_320x32Bit, Hatari
- 7.2%, sseCGSConvertXXXX8888TransposeMask, CoreGraphics
- 4.1%, Video_ColorReg_WriteWord, Hatari
  3.9%, lo_alltraps, mach_kernel

m68k_go = main function for m68k emulation
ConvertSpec512_320x32Bit = converts 4-bit Atari screen
	with palette tricks to host 32-bit format.

Btw. I had forgotten that OSX is using 32-bit screen, so there's more
overhead than on my system from the conversion as it needs to deal
with more data (I'm running 16-bit myself).  That doesn't seem to grow
so much though. 


On 2x zoom the bottlenecks are:
- 13.7%, sseCGSConvertXXXX8888TransposeMask, CoreGraphics
- 9.4%, ConvertSpec512_640x32Bit, Hatari
  5.9%, lo_alltraps, mach_kernel
- 4.4%, pmap_enter, mach_kernel
- 4.4%, m68k_go, Hatari

The main issue seems to be some sseCGSConvertXXXX8888TransposeMask()
function.    I assume this is some Quarz function called by SDL or libraries
below it, Hatari definitely isn't calling it.

This is a mail I found on the subject:
	<A HREF="http://lists.apple.com/archives/quartz-dev/2008/Oct/msg00034.html">http://lists.apple.com/archives/quartz-dev/2008/Oct/msg00034.html</A>

Somebody on OSX needs to debug why that thing is called and how it can be
avoided.  It probable requires fixing SDL, either its surface allocation or
blitting code.

PS.  This wasn't an issue, but in general when profiling graphics, you could
use --sound off so that the stuff that audio threads do wouldn't appear on
the profiles.
