Hello,

I think there's something that is not correctly initialized at the start 
(when creating MixBuffer), sound delay should not be dependant on 
MIXBUFFER_SIZE as this is just a buffer to store samples and then picking 
data in it to send to SDL. What is important is how many bytes we send to 
SDL, not how many bytes we use in our internal ring buffer.

&gt;<i> Reducing the MIXBUFFER_SIZE value reduce also the delay.
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps we could use a variable value here which would be dependant of the sound frequency ?
</I>&gt;<i> (The sound buffer would be smaller for a low frequency and bigger for a high frequency)
</I>
We should not mix the meaning of MixBuffer and SDL's buffer (the one 
having 'size' bytes when calling Audio_Init).
I have the feeling that reducing MIXBUFFER_SIZE to fix the problem is a 
side effect and is a wrong answer to a real problem.

SDL should not be affected by MIXBUFFER_SIZE, that's why I'd like to get 
the values printed after calling Audio_Init to compare them with my values 
under linux (where I don't have any delay). In the case of SDL, we use 
1024 samples per block, which is a rather &quot;aggresive&quot; value that should 
give low latency, but maybe the host OS resizes this value to something 
bigger.

If ActiveSndBufIdx is not correctly set at the beginning, then we can get 
a constant delay.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             After looking at audio.c , MIXBUFFER_SIZE looked like
</I>&gt;<i>             a good place to start.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             Thus, in sound.h:
</I>&gt;<i>             #define MIXBUFFER_SIZE&#160;&#160;&#160; 16384
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             Was changed to:
</I>&gt;<i>             #define MIXBUFFER_SIZE&#160;&#160;&#160; 2048
</I>&gt;<i>             ( I figured that this should Not reduce the delay.
</I>&gt;<i>             &#160;However, it does. Is this a problem too?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             And compiled and run (working ok) with the following warning:
</I>&gt;<i>             Warning: Soundbuffer size is too big!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             So back to audio.c, line 124 to change some code:
</I>&gt;<i>             &#160;&#160;&#160; if (SoundBufferSize &gt; MIXBUFFER_SIZE/2)
</I>&gt;<i>             Was changed to:
</I>&gt;<i>             &#160;&#160;&#160; if (SoundBufferSize/4 &gt; MIXBUFFER_SIZE/2)
</I>&gt;<i>             ( Because desiredAudioSpec.samples is in [samples],
</I>&gt;<i>             &#160;MIXBUFFER_SIZE is in [samples],
</I>&gt;<i>             &#160;But SoundBufferSize = desiredAudioSpec.size; is in [bytes]
</I>&gt;<i>             &#160;Bytes are multiplied by 2 for stereo and 2 for Sint16 )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             It turns out that MIXBUFFER_SIZE = 2048 is the smallest size
</I>&gt;<i>             without a warning (MIXBUFFER_SIZE has enough space for twice
</I>&gt;<i>             the data because of its design as a circular buffer).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>             Hope that helps.

</I>&gt;<i>       Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       I had a look at Hatari's code and I don't see how changing MIXBUFFER_SIZE can change the delay of audio sound.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       SDL is initialized with &quot;desiredAudioSpec.samples = 1024&quot;, so for 44.1 kHz this means 0.023 sec during each sdl callback and for 8 kHz this would
</I>&gt;<i>       give a 0.128 sec so this should be some pretty reasonable delay, hardly noticeable.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       So, the only value SDL will &quot;know&quot; is 1024 ; this means Audio_CallBack will be called with len=1024 and even at 8 kHz, the sound will be played as
</I>&gt;<i>       chunk of 0.128 sec.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       The fact that you get a shortened delay by changing an Hatari's variable (MIXBUFFER_SIZE) instead of an SDL's one (desiredAudioSpec.samples) makes
</I>&gt;<i>       me believe the problem could be in the way MixBuffer is initialized, as well as SoundBufferSize (sound.c, line 922) :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; nGeneratedSamples = SoundBufferSize + SAMPLES_PER_FRAME;
</I>&gt;<i>       &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; ActiveSndBufIdx = nGeneratedSamples % MIXBUFFER_SIZE;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       If SoundBuffer is too high, we could get ActiveSndBufIdx too &quot;far ahead&quot; which would create a delay.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       Could you add a line in Audio_Init in audio.c after the call to SDL_OpenAudio (before &quot;SoundBufferSize = desiredAudioSpec.size&quot;) :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       fprintf ( stderr , &quot;freq %d samples %d size %d\n&quot; , desiredAudioSpec.freq , desiredAudioSpec.samples , desiredAudioSpec.size );
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       And then try changing freq in hatari (8000, 11000, 44100) to see what is printed ; I'd like to compare these values with what I get under my linux.
