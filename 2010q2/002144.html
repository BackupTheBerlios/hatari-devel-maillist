<PRE>Hi,

On Thursday 13 May 2010, <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/hatari-devel">npomarede at corp.free.fr</A> wrote:
&gt;<i> &gt; But I was thinking of another solution, for two reasons:

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - what we do when we run out of 64 flag bits?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; What if subsystems with more flags would have their own flag variables?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For example video stuff has currently 8 flags.  You could use for those
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a different macro (LOG_TRACE_VIDEO()?) which uses a different flag
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; variable.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Support for different variables would need to be added to log.c too.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> regarding &quot;long long&quot; I agree they may not be native on all
</I>&gt;<i> architectures, but they're at the core of cycInt.c, and
</I>&gt;<i> CycInt_SetNewInterrupt is called much more often than log could be, so
</I>&gt;<i> that shouldn't be noticeable.
</I>
The interrupt handling is earlier already about the heaviest thing in Hatari
for ST emulation on my 32-bit machine (about the same as the m86k emulation
itself).  Maybe it's because of 64-bit stuff there? :-)


&gt;<i> I don't think we will need more than 64 different log levels. We already
</I>&gt;<i> added logs in all parts, we need a few more for the DSP and maybe some
</I>&gt;<i> others here and there, but we shouldn't need more than 32 new ones.
</I>&gt;<i> 64 should be a limit we can manage.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We should have a method :
</I>&gt;<i>   - which is fast to test (so we don't get too much penalty when debug
</I>&gt;<i> code is enabled at compile time)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   - which doesn't require to change the existing LOG calls in all the
</I>&gt;<i> sources.
</I>
Neither proposal requires this.


&gt;<i> I'm not sure we require such a level of detail to split log macros
</I>&gt;<i> between video, sound, ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Current code basically does :
</I>&gt;<i>  	if (LogTraceFlags &amp; level)
</I>&gt;<i>  		{ print ... }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> new possible methods :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   1) set LogTraceFlags to Uint64 -&gt; nothing else to change, we now have
</I>&gt;<i> 64 bits to play with and the test remains fast (apart from dealing with
</I>&gt;<i> 64 bits int)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   2) have a global variable LogTraceOn = true or false and some
</I>&gt;<i> additional Uint32 to store flags (LogTraceFlags1, LogTraceFlags2, ...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> with 2), code could become :
</I>&gt;<i>  	if ( LogTraceOn )
</I>&gt;<i>  	{
</I>&gt;<i>  		if ( level matches LogTraceFlags1 level
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  			|| level matches LogTraceFlags2 )
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  			{ print ... }
</I>&gt;<i>  	}
</I>
None of above is necessary with what I proposed.


If we would e.g. decide that video.c trace would have its own flags
variable, we would have just:

in log.h additional define:
#define LOG_VIDEO_TRACE(level, args...) \
        if (unlikely(LogTraceVideoFlags &amp; level)) fprintf(TraceFile, args)

And in video.c repace LOG_TRACE with LOG_VIDEO_TRACE.

Only complication would be in log.c log options parsing because it would
need to set bits in different flag variables.


&gt;<i> problem is : how do we compare *rapidly* the value of level with several
</I>&gt;<i> LogTraceFlagsX variables ?
</I>
Trivially. :-)


&gt;<i> I would go for 1st solution, as it requires nearly no changes ; or any
</I>&gt;<i> other solution that doesn't require to modify all the sources files that
</I>&gt;<i> have LOG_TRACE calls (only modifications should go to log.c / log.h) as
</I>&gt;<i> this would come to commit nearly the whole source tree, which is quite
</I>&gt;<i> overkill and not really readable.
</I>
I guess the 64-bit thing could be tried first and if it seems to be causing
performance issue (would be hard to see though because with macros it's not
centralized to single place), then use separate flag variables.
