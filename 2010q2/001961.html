<PRE>Hi,

I've given this more thought.

I've decided it's best if this just marks profiling to be enabled.
Continuing would be done separately by the user, i.e. instruction
count won't be given here.

Profiling results would be output when user gets back to debugger
again.

This way user can enable both CPU and DSP profiling at the same time.

I'm doing everything on the Hatari side after all.  It will just be pretty
brute-force.

I've thought to use a huge array like this:
struct {
	Uint32 addr;
	Uint32 count;
	/* Uint32 cycles;	// later */
} profdata[STRamSize];

While the execution is traced, only count is updated (+cycles later).

Afterwards this array is scanned for addresses which were updated. Addresses
are added (addr=index) from lowest updated item to the highest and then
they're just qsort()ed based on the counts.

First topmost sorted addresses are shown.  Then they're scanned for
addresses that match function addresses and topmost N of those are shown.

After cycles support is added, the topmost addresses (in cycles) and topmost
functions (in call counts) need to be sorted separately.


For DSP side it works exactly like this, for the CPU side I need to handle
TOS area accesses separately as TOS are is mapped to separate address.

-&gt; I've thought to start with DSP after 1.4 is released.

...

</I>&gt;<i> This would be a fantastic feature :)
</I>
I thought so too, especially as this doesn't seem very complicated to
implement.  ;-)
