<PRE>Hi,

I can reproduce the problem with latest Hatari version, in color mode,
both under VDI 2 &amp; 4-bit modes and the default EmuTOS Falcon color
resolution.  It doesn't happen in the 1-bit mode.

If I use TeraDesk &quot;window&quot; mode for the dialogs, then the dialog contents
are trashed instead of the dialog background.


&gt;<i> This problem does not happen with Hatari + TOS 4.04, and never happens
</I>&gt;<i> with ARAnyM in any configuration.
</I>
If I run TeraDesk with ST/STE emulation instead of Falcon one, EmuTOS
panics when any dialog is opened.  This is with ST low.  In monchrome
mode it works fine[1] for ST/STE mode too.


&gt;<i> Several monthes ago, there was a similar bug in ARAnyM and XaAES when
</I>&gt;<i> moving windows. This was caused by a bug in SDL, in some manually
</I>&gt;<i> written assembly code for x86.
</I>
When I quickly tested this with an old v1.1 of Hatari for ARM, it had
exactly the same problem.  I.e. this doesn't seem to be x86 specific
problem.


&gt;<i> It has been fixed in ARAnyM now. 
</I>&gt;<i> Since Hatari use SDL, too, I wonder if this could be another effect of
</I>&gt;<i> the same bug.
</I>
I've understood that Aranym uses Aranym specific FVDI drivers and contains
code for implementing the drawing functions on the host side with SDL.
Hatari doesn't do anything like that, it emulates pure screen memory and
issues like that would have been very visible with demos etc.

Because EmuTOS panics on ST/STE while on Falcon there's memory corruption,
I'm pretty this is either EmuTOS or TeraDesk bug.  Knowing the EmuTOS GEM &amp; 
VDI support level, I think this issue is in EmuTOS.


As I don't see how this kind of issue would happen if the dialog background
would be redrawn, I think the issue is in the saving &amp; restoring of the
dialog background memory area.

According to gemdos tracing, TeraDesk does these gemdos operations
when the dialog is opened:
GEMDOS call 0x44 (Mxalloc)
GEMDOS call 0x44 (Mxalloc)
GEMDOS call 0x48 (Malloc)

During the dialog moving, TeraDesk doesn't do any gemdos operations.
When dialog is closed, it does:
GEMDOS call 0x49 (Mfree)

So either the dialog background save &amp; restore is done to memory TeraDesk
(or library it's using) allocated when creating the dialog, or this is done
by EmuTOS.


VDI tracing (which you can do with Hatari when emulating external graphics)
didn't tell anything useful because EmuTOS/TeraDesk is constantly doing some
VDI operations so I couldn't see whether there's e.g. some VDI blit
operations done when moving the dialog.
-&gt; means that instruction tracing with symbols would be hard to decipher too

I think you're going to see the issue also on ColdFire.

[1] Until this thing I've reported earlier (mono dialogs + fast forward):
hatari: cycInt.c:377: CycInt_AddRelativeInterruptWithOffset: Assertion 
`CycleTime &gt;= 0' failed.
