I had some extra time, so I completed this.  As it's a general usability
improvement,  doesn't need updating manual, is fairly isolated &amp; seemed
to work fine, I pushed it to repo:
	<A HREF="http://hg.berlios.de/repos/hatari/rev/8195baf82d1b">http://hg.berlios.de/repos/hatari/rev/8195baf82d1b</A>

Anders, could you verify that it works fine?



&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Hatari doesn't have any control over refresh rate or how
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; fullscreening is implemented, only what what window/screen size it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; would like to have. Rest is (intentionally) hidden by SDL.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, that's why the technicque of changing resolution is flawed to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; begin with. Fullscreen should use the _current_ resolution without any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; change and scale the graphics accordingly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hm.  After some googling, an API seems to have been added to SDL
</I>&gt;<i> in v1.2.10 to get the current resolution:
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/docwiki.cgi/SDL_VideoInfo">http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/docwiki.cgi/SDL_VideoInfo</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I assume it would need to be called before setting the Hatari window size
</I>&gt;<i> for the first time.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does anybody know whether there are still used/updated Linux
</I>&gt;<i> distributions or OSX / Windows / BSD versions which ship with an older
</I>&gt;<i> version of SDL?
</I>
Anybody?   Do all distros still being maintained have at least SDL v1.2.10?
