&gt;<i> Hatari doesn't have any control over refresh rate or how

</I>&gt;<i> size it would like to have. Rest is (intentionally) hidden by SDL.
</I>
Maybe a solution would be to simply make the current window the size
of the screen, fill it with black, then render the virtual screen as
big as possible in the window? That *seems* to be what VICE (C64 emu)
does on OS X, and since that approach doesn't alter the screen
resolution, I get to keep my 50Hz without Hatari needing to bother.

Maybe as an option &quot;Fullscreen uses current screen settings&quot; or
something like that?

Just a thought.

Per.
