<PRE>Hi,

On Thursday 15 April 2010, <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/hatari-devel">npomarede at corp.free.fr</A> wrote:

Sounds good to me.

The remaining things I had on my current TODO list were:
1. Support for the max width/height settings in Hatari (Python) UI
2. manual.html update for the splitted screen dialog
3. Update the etc/n810.cfg config file &amp; README and test Hatari on N810
    in regards to the borders / max width&amp;height stuff
   - Thomas, could you check/update the win-ce.cfg?
4. Test symbol debugging with normal processes, maybe add something
    more about that to manual page
4. Re-organize the tests/-directory contents a bit
5. Do the ACSI / IDE partition numbering the same way

At least 1 &amp; 2 need to be done before release, but I should have them
done by end of next week.

Rest can be done for v1.4.1 I think.  5) is a minor behavioural change
though, so maybe it needs to be post-poned for v1.5.


&gt;<i> For example, laurent told he wouldn't have much time in the following
</I>&gt;<i> weeks, but do you (laurent) consider current dma code would be good for
</I>&gt;<i> release ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Note that once release is made and now that I can build hatari for
</I>&gt;<i> windows under linux (and I'm sure we could find people to provide an OSX
</I>&gt;<i> build), we could even imagine a shorter release cycle for a 1.4.1 version
</I>&gt;<i> in 3 months for example (instead of the usual ~6 months).
</I>
If there are regressions or clear bugs we hadn't noticed, I guess it could
be sooner too. :-)

For example the CMake build could be one such thing.
The 64-bit file stuff issue is still unresolved.
