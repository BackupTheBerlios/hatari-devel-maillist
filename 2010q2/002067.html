Hello!

Oh no don't try this on me :)  I've reported many times that in OS X 
window mode, Hatari is slow as snails, while in fullscreen it works fast.

The problems in fullscreen however are that virtual desktops doesn't work, 
refresh rate changes, video resolution changes and it doesn't do double 
buffering so there is screen tearing.



&gt;<i> Does the slowness you're reporting happen only when overlay LED is
</I>&gt;<i> enabled (not necessary visible) and statusbar is disabled?
</I>&gt;<i> Or does it happen also if statusbar is enabled or both statusbar &amp; led are
</I>&gt;<i> disabled?
</I>
The general slowness is whatever of statusbar/HUD status. It's something 
to do with updating the actual window. Something is horribly wrong in the 
screen blit. But this has been brought up time and time again.



&gt;<i> To me it seems 1/2 (or maybe 1/3) of normal speed.  I think easy way to
</I>&gt;<i> check how much the slowdown is would be to try frameskip values of 1 or 2.
</I>&gt;<i> Btw. If OSX SDL is doing VSync() on windowed mode and you have an LCD
</I>&gt;<i> monitor, you probably should be running Hatari with frameskip anyway.
</I>&gt;<i> Otherwise OSX/SDL is forcing e.g. monochrome mode (71Hz updates...) to
</I>&gt;<i> be running too slowly as LCD refresh is usually something like 60Hz.
</I>&gt;<i> (My CRT refresh is 85Hz so I cannot see issues like this.)
</I>
Come on, so the solution to a small little green box slowing down Hatari 
to a crawl is to frameskip it, not to fix the thing that slows it down?



&gt;<i> Is OSX that primitive? :-)
</I>&gt;<i> I can do that without a script on Linux and I think it's possible on Windows
</I>&gt;<i> also.  Heck, it's even possible to do in Atari Teradesk (not as desktop
</I>&gt;<i> icon, but for programs configured to handle specific file types).
</I>
Yeah it's very primitive. Only one mouse button, only AppleTalk network
and you can't install any program Steve Jobs personally hasn't granted you 
access to install.



&gt;&gt;<i> All comptuers made the last decade or 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so have hardware scaling support, and older machines than that are too
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> slow for Hatari anyways. Apart from the hwardware scaling, a modern
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compter can do software scaling without a blink as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, yours seems to have problems getting the updates to screen
</I>&gt;<i> frequently enough.  ;-))
</I>
Funny, now you remember that I've reported performance issues before..


&gt;&gt;<i> See the Vice emulator as a great example how things can be implemented.
</I>&gt;<i> Is it implemented on top of SDL?
</I>
I have no idea, but the implementation is great.


&gt;&gt;<i> This wouldn't even let me go to fullscreen at all.
</I>&gt;<i> It works fine on Linux SDL.  Please file a bug against OSX SDL,
</I>&gt;<i> HWSURFACE is an optional thing according to SDL documenation.
</I>&gt;<i> See the documentation on it to see why I asked to test removing it:
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/docwiki.cgi/SDL_SetVideoMode">http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/docwiki.cgi/SDL_SetVideoMode</A>
</I>

Wonderful, I knew this was coming, Hatari is fault free and the problem 
lies elsewhere, even though Hatari includes the &quot;elsewhere&quot; code.
