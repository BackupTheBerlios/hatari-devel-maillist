<PRE>Hi,

I was thinking of adding profiling support to the Hatari debugger:
--------
'profile' - profile which part of the code is most used
Usage:  profile &lt;instruction count&gt; [show count]
        Runs the emulation a given number of instructions and shows
        which addresses were most used.
--------

I was thinking of implementing most of this functionality outside of Hatari.

On the Hatari side this would enable SPCFLAG_DEBUGGER flag to catch
every instruction and pass their PC address outside of Hatari.

An external program would then process the PC address information,
count how many times each address is executed and at the end print
out the most used addresses.

I was thinking that Hatari could directly invoke the external program
and feed the data to it through its stdin to avoid huge intermediate
files and to get the information immediately.


Future profiling functionality could be:
* In addition to addresses, give how many cycles was spent at that address
  so that the program can count which addresses spend most cycles.
* Pass the loaded (code) symbols addresses to the external program.
  With this it can list which functions were called most often and how
  many times.

(With the additional information about subroutine returns, the external
program might eventually be even able to construct call graphs[1], but
I think that quite unlikely. :-))

Comments?
