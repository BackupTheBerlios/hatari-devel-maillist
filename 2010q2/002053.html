<PRE>Hi,

On Tuesday 11 May 2010, Anders Eriksson wrote:

</I>&gt;<i> 1. Today you can either have the statusbar on, which is a cludge and

</I>&gt;<i> the statusbar.  The problem with the HUD is that

</I>&gt;<i> green little square makes Hatari ten times slower when it's visible)
</I>
Things that it does are just:
1. save (just) the area below the square
&lt;screen update&gt;
2. blit the square, but only when needed

This doesn't have noticeable impact on Hatari speed on Linux, but maybe
OSX/SDL want e.g. to do VSync() both on reading a minuscule piece of
the window contents and writing a similar minuscule piece back to it...

If this slowdown happens only on fullscreen, could you try removing
the HWSURFACE option from screen.c sdlVideoFlags and see whether
it changes anything?


Because Falcon &amp; TT screen updates work differently (everything is
updated everytime), step 1) is skipped there.  Do you see less slowdown
there?


(I have on TODO list an item to redo ST/STE side screen drawing in a way
that would also get rid of 1), but It's a large thing, so don't expect it
before year end. :-))


&gt;<i> Can we have an option so we can disable both statusbar and HUD, pretty
</I>&gt;<i> please?
</I>
Use &quot;--statusbar off&quot;[1], or set bShowDriveLed in configuration file to
FALSE.

I had it for a while in the Hatari SDL GUI too, but had to remove it to make
space for other options.  Attached is a patch to have it back, but it makes
the screen dialog look a bit off-balance and it would need the HTML manual
update too.

The Python/Gtk Hatari GUI of course has an option for this in its UI.


[1] From Hatari command line, debugger, through control socket, or from
inside the emulation through the XBios(255) call (when --bios-intercept is
used).


&gt;<i> 2. Multiple configurations easily accessible. Today I have a custom
</I>&gt;<i> written tool especially for Hatari to load it with different config files
</I>&gt;<i> easily. To go in and select a new configfile via fileselector isn't
</I>&gt;<i> what I call easily accessible.
</I>
Hm.  I think I've answered to this several times...

If you have specific configuration between which you'd like to use, IMHO
easiest way is to add shortcuts to your desktop which tell Hatari which
config file to use (with &quot;--configfile &lt;file&gt;&quot; option).


&gt;<i> It would be ace to have this feature directly under the OS X dropdown
</I>
Oh, this was to whoever maintains OSX UI.

This option is there already for the Hatari Python/Gtk UI, but that doesn't
have (yet) support for remembering recently loaded config files.  I added
TODO item for that.


&gt;<i> (as with insert-floppy). 
</I>
IMHO best is to set Hatari as handler for *.st and *.msa files so that you
can just double click on a disk floppy to run Hatari (with suitable config).


&gt;<i> 3. When creating a new floppy-image, an alert asking if we want to mount
</I>&gt;<i> it to drive a or b would be very nice (especially in the OS X gui).
</I>
Good idea.

I commited support for getting the information whether the creation of
the disk image succeeded (and if it required overwrite, whether user
agreed to that).

Attached is mostly untested patch for adding question on whether the (last) 
succesfully created disk image should be inserted to drive A:. I think
drive B: is too rare case to worry about (and it would need creating a new
dialog).


&gt;<i> 4. Then we have the usual long-term request of using the current
</I>&gt;<i> resolution and refreshrate instead of changing it when going to
</I>&gt;<i> fullscreen.
</I>
Resolution thing should already work for Falcon &amp; TT screens?
They use completely different code from ST/STE.


&gt;<i> I realise this is probably a bigger task, but never the less 
</I>&gt;<i> it would be so nice to have. The problems with todays approach are
</I>&gt;<i>     a) The monitor takes time to resync for each fullscreen toggle
</I>&gt;<i>     b) Virtual desktops in OS X stops working (you can't have Hatari in
</I>&gt;<i> fullscreen and switch to another virtual desktop, without
</I>&gt;<i> un-fullscreening Hatari first)
</I>&gt;<i>     c) Hatari does not honour the current refresh rate when switching
</I>&gt;<i> resolution, so if you have a nice 50 Hz screen (perfect when running
</I>&gt;<i> ST/STe stuff in Hatari) it will change to something else in fullscreen.
</I>
Hatari doesn't have any control over refresh rate or how fullscreening
is implemented, only what what window/screen size it would like to have.
Rest is (intentionally) hidden by SDL.

You could try whether removing HWSURFACE option from screen.c has
any effect on this.  If it has, we could consider making it optional.
