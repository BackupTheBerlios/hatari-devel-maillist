<PRE>Hi,

Some strings have just &quot;s&quot;.  And keys are prefixed with &quot;key&quot;.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's say we have 50 variables today in the config file with prefix, and

There are about 160 variables.


&gt;<i> that in the near future with various emulation improvements/changes we

</I>&gt;<i> we can allow a transition and not enforce adding a prefix to each
</I>&gt;<i> variable.
</I>
Sure.

But please, let's not do that single variable at the time and not just
before release (I fixed the name in repo).
 

&gt;<i> &gt; 2) Hatari UI uses[1] the prefix for converting the string from the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    configuration file to a correct type when it reads the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; configuration.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> From the code in config.py, text_to_value tries to convert text to int,
</I>&gt;<i> if this works it's an int, if it fails it's a string, so the name/prefix
</I>&gt;<i> of the variable is not used (and I think that's the correct way to do it)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then in value_to_text, there's an assert to check the prefix is in the
</I>&gt;<i> variable's name, but since the variable is already stored in python's
</I>&gt;<i> memory, using valtype seems enough to me to decide how &quot;value&quot; should be
</I>&gt;<i> printed to the configuration file.
</I>
The changed values don't come from a configuration file, but from the code.
The asserts are there to catch wrong types coming e.g. from pygtk widgets,
that cannot work if it doesn't know the type.  The checks have helped me
several times in the past.


&gt;<i> For all those other languages, you could try to atoi() the value as you
</I>&gt;<i> do in python and decide on the resulting type this way. If the user needs
</I>&gt;<i> to change the value through the UI, then you know the type int or string
</I>&gt;<i> and you can check that only numbers are entered if type is int.
</I>
It's a bit more complicated.  There are three types, booleans, integers and
strings.  Booleans are &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, not 0 or 1.  Empty string is &quot;&quot;,
not 0 (unlike with atoi()).

Tim Peters' &quot;Zen of Python&quot; has IMHO really well compressed design advice
for any language. :-)
