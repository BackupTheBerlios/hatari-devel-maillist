<PRE>Hi,

Ah, you're right.  It works for the DSP etc stuff because relevant files
include the config.h file, but it's not enough for Mudflap because there are
files which don't include it (and therefore don't get recompiled).

Use of these includes also gets config.h:
$&#160;find -name '*.h'|xargs grep config.h
./debug/log.h:#include &quot;config.h&quot;
./includes/str.h:#include &lt;config.h&gt;
./includes/main.h:#include &quot;config.h&quot;
./includes/ioMem.h:#include &quot;config.h&quot;

And although there are fewer files not depending on config.h directly or 
indirectly than I originally thought, there still are some:
$ for i in $(find -name '*.c'); do \
egrep -q '(config.h|log.h|str.h|main.h|ioMem.h)' $i; \
if [ $? == 1 ]; then echo $i; fi; \
done|grep -v -e gui-win -e /convert/
./ide-qmu.c
./uae-cpu/gencpu.c
./uae-cpu/cpustbl.c
./uae-cpu/fpp.c
./uae-cpu/readcpu.c
./uae-cpu/cpudefs.c
./uae-cpu/cpuemu.c
./cartData.c
./utils.c

Most likely these haven't got any issues, but uae-cpu core data still needs
to be protected.  I.e. it's better to do make clean before rebuilding with
Mudflap.

After today that is...


&gt;<i> &gt; set(CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES &quot;mudflap&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CHECK_C_COMPILER_FLAG(&quot;-fmudflapth&quot; MUDFLAP_AVAILABLE)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; set(CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES &quot;&quot;)
</I>
I noticed that later in the file readline check does something similar:
------------
if(READLINE_FOUND)
        set(CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES &quot;readline&quot;)
        check_function_exists(rl_filename_completion_function HAVE_RL_...
        if(HAVE_RL_COMPLETION_FUNCTION)
                set(HAVE_LIBREADLINE 1)
        else()
                unset(READLINE_FOUND)
        endif(HAVE_RL_COMPLETION_FUNCTION)
        set(CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES &quot;&quot;)
endif(READLINE_FOUND)
------------

But shouldn't the CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES be restored to the previous
value instead of an empty one?  Or is it used only for doing tests like
this, not building the software[1]?

(CMake manual doesn't tell.)


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I had the documentation on the Mudflap usage in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; Makefile-default.cnf (as it was developers only and I couldn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; think of a better place), I guess something similar to this can now
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt; be put to the main CMakefile?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; The attached patch does also this.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ok, looks good, please commit if the CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES fix is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; working for you, too!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, this didn't seem to work:
</I>&gt;<i>         set(LINK_FLAGS &quot;${LINK_FLAGS} -fmudflapth -lmudflap&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> According CMake manual, it's supposed to:
</I>&gt;<i>        LINK_FLAGS
</I>&gt;<i>               Additional flags to use when linking this target.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But this didn't show up in linker line and I didn't find any other CMake
</I>&gt;<i> option for giving both linker flags and extra libraries.
</I>
Ok, found one: CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS

I commited the support now.


[1] CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES didn't seem to have any effect for Hatari
linking.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Is there some easier way to get builds with both optimization and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; debug symbols than this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 	cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:string=RelWithDebInfo ..
</I>
Btw. because Mudflap is about useless without debug info, I added &quot;-g&quot;
to CFLAGS whenever it's enabled, regardless of build type.

Building with mudflap is now:
	cd build; make clean; cmake -D ENABLE_MUDFLAP:BOOL=1 ..
instead of:
	make clean; make MUDFLAP=1

(documented in the main CMakeLists.txt.)
