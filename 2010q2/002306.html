</I>
The new build system is available since month, so don't dare to say
that this is less tested than your new patches.

&gt;<i> If there are tested &amp; already working new features, I don't see why
</I>&gt;<i> they couldn't be included to the release to get wider testing for
</I>&gt;<i> them, if that doesn't need too much effort.
</I>
Bug fix releases should normally only fix bugs, not introduce new
features which can _always_ contain new bugs.
However, if we still decide to add new features to a bugfix release, we
should then rather cherry-pick the appropriate patches instead of
blindly releasing the hg tip.
 
&gt;<i> (Removing the (other) v1.4 build system complicates things like that
</I>&gt;<i> to some extent (like other larger changes) without adding any extra
</I>&gt;<i> value.)
</I>
As I mentioned above, a proper bugfix release should always be done on
a separate branch. That's also how I did it for the 1.3.1 release a
year ago.

&gt;<i> &gt; That's your stuff only, so I leave it up to you to add it to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; CMake files.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> How / why?
</I>
Maybe by reading the friendly documentation of cmake and having a try?
;-)

&gt;<i> Test stuff is developer-only and contains Linux specific things like
</I>&gt;<i> running the tests under Valgrind (which is Linux only), so I think
</I>&gt;<i> it's fine to have a normal GNU Makefile there.
</I>
Why did you run valgrind from within the Makefile? Shouldn't this
rather be a separate shell script?

&gt;<i> As to Mudflap debugging support, I have no idea how to add support
</I>&gt;<i> to it to CMake, I need your help there.
</I>
Well, don't be so lazy, Eero, just have a try, ... and if you get
stuck, I still can try to help you there.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Please add those or restore the Makefiles.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Or what?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, it's a bit unfair to remove &amp; break other's code without a
</I>&gt;<i> warning. I think I'm entitled to cry &quot;foul&quot;.  :-)
</I>
This certainly hasn't been without a notice. Well, ok, there wasn't a
direct warning yesterday, but I think we discussed it clearly on this
mailing list to keep the old Makefiles for the 1.4 release and to
remove them afterwards. You added mudflap support just a couple of
weeks ago, so instead of adding it to the old Makefiles, you could have
also added it directly to the new CMake-files instead.

So please stop behaving like an offended child now, and try to get used
to cmake at last instead.

 Thomas
