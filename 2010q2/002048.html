Hi,

there are a few small things in Hatari that annoys me (and more people as 
I've learnt) that could perhaps be fixed for v1.4. These are not 
complicated things and I guess they could be quick to implement.

1. Today you can either have the statusbar on, which is a cludge and looks 
crappy, especially in fullscreen. Or you can have a HUD instead of the 
statusbar.  The problem with the HUD is that
   a) it appears on screenshots and
   b) it slows down Hatari on OS X -A LOT- when it's active (yep, that 
green little square makes Hatari ten times slower when it's visible)

Can we have an option so we can disable both statusbar and HUD, pretty 
please?


2. Multiple configurations easily accessible. Today I have a custom 
written tool especially for Hatari to load it with different config files 
easily. To go in and select a new configfile via fileselector isn't 
what I call easily accessible. It would be ace to have this feature 
directly under the OS X dropdown (as with insert-floppy).


3. When creating a new floppy-image, an alert asking if we want to mount 
it to drive a or b would be very nice (especially in the OS X gui).


4. Then we have the usual long-term request of using the current 
resolution and refreshrate instead of changing it when going to 
fullscreen. I realise this is probably a bigger task, but never the less 
it would be so nice to have. The problems with todays approach are
    a) The monitor takes time to resync for each fullscreen toggle
    b) Virtual desktops in OS X stops working (you can't have Hatari in 
fullscreen and switch to another virtual desktop, without un-fullscreening 
Hatari first)
    c) Hatari does not honour the current refresh rate when switching 
resolution, so if you have a nice 50 Hz screen (perfect when running 
ST/STe stuff in Hatari) it will change to something else in fullscreen.


Thanks for reading.
