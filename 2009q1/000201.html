<PRE>Hi,

On Wednesday 18 March 2009, Thomas Huth wrote:

</I>
EmuTOS would seem to trash[1] the partition only when the image size is 2MB
or 4MB.  8MB and 16MB partitions seem to work fine on quick testing.

[1] = Removes all directories instead of the one I selected and overwrites
     the partition name.  Mtools says that the partition doesn't have name
     or any files.


&gt;<i> &gt; - TOS/HDDriver demo recognizes it only in --ide mode, but for

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   (even when -D isn't used)
</I>
This seems to happen only with earlier TOS versions.
With TOS4 and EmuTOS the driver just bombs out.
Machine (st/falcon) doesn't affect it.


&gt;<i> Is there an additional error message, e.g. a bus error?
</I>
Yes: M68000_BusError at address $ff8781


&gt;<i> There is also one call to DebugUI() in ide.c ... maybe that's the
</I>&gt;<i> culprit. Could you add a printf there to see whether this triggers the
</I>&gt;<i> debugger?
</I>
Yes, it's this one.


&gt;<i> I think it save to remove these to lines from ide.c now, I 
</I>&gt;<i> just needed them for debugging when I adapted the IDE code to Hatari.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - TOS/Cecile bombs with the resulting image
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Which machine mode did you use? I think Cecile only works on Falcon or
</I>&gt;<i> at least 68020 mode...
</I>
Ah, that was it.  When using Falcon, Cecile doesn't bomb.

However, although it recognizes Hatari/IDE, it doesn't recognize
the partition created with the script (-&gt; no C:).


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I've also applied this to zip2st.sh now and it works very well!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I did some additional changes to it (more user friendliness).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the latest version, I now get the following error message at the
</I>&gt;<i> end:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /home/thomas/devel/hatari/master/tools/zip2st.sh: 1: exit_cleanup: not
</I>&gt;<i> found
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand that, since exit_cleanup is defined as a function
</I>&gt;<i> there...
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe dash does not allow functions to be used as trap programs? It
</I>&gt;<i> works when I change the /bin/sh line at the beginning to /bin/bash ...
</I>
It didn't recognize the whole function as I had used the &quot;function&quot; keyword
(which is optional in the POSIX standard).  I commited a fix.

PS. Now I'm getting on commits:
error: changegroup.notify hook raised an exception: diffstat() got an 
unexpected keyword argument 'width'
