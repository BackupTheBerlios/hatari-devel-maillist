What do you mean by that? Was there a problem?

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; + The SDL audio buffer size is frequency dependant (and small).
</I>
I don't think that this is a good idea to use sizes smaller than 512...
according to the SDL documentation:

&quot; desired-&gt;samples : The desired size of the audio buffer in samples.
This number should be a power of two, and may be adjusted by the audio
driver to a value more suitable for the hardware. Good values seem to
range between 512 and 8192 inclusive, depending on the application and
CPU speed. Smaller values yield faster response time, but can lead to
underflow if the application is doing heavy processing and cannot fill
the audio buffer in time. &quot;

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; + Added some 4 pole filters (configurable).
</I>
What are they good for? There is hardly any comment in your patch about
them.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - Now, when a ym register is written, the affected sample number
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; is computed and the change is stored in a list.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; When the SDL audio callback needs samples, it calls the ym
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; emulation, and the ym emulation replay the history and generate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the samples.
</I>
So where's the advantage to the old way of generating the samples
directly?

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - The Dma sound generation is done the same way. The SDL audio
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; callback ask some samples to the Dma emulation (but there's no
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; history).
</I>
But what happens when the ST memory has changed inbetween? You might
copy wrong that in that case?!

&gt;<i>   - many parts of the mixing routines for dma sound are using float
</I>&gt;<i> and other math functions (ceilf, ...). I think this is a little
</I>&gt;<i> overkill to use float for every sample to compute its resampled
</I>&gt;<i> version (perhaps libsamplerate could do this optionnaly).
</I>[...]
&gt;<i> If we consider embeded/non desktop PC as Hatari's targets too, trying
</I>&gt;<i> to avoid float should help maintaining performance.
</I>
Right, it's also bad on for performance on PowerPC CPUs.
If possible, you should avoid float&lt;-&gt;int conversions.

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; PS: about 'improve the dma resampling', maybe *optionally* with a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; configure flag we could use libsamplerate ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know ; does it really improve sound a lot at 44.1 kHz ? I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not sure the real problem to get a sound really close to dma is
</I>&gt;<i> resampling, but more in the modeling of filters that match the
</I>&gt;<i> original 1 kohm resistance between the sound chip and the left/right
</I>&gt;<i> output for instance.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas's policy was to keep dependancies at the minimum to allow 
</I>&gt;<i> compilation on as much system (including the &quot;broken&quot; ones), but
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps that if the code is made optional with configure this could
</I>&gt;<i> be used (but once again, I'm not sure that libresample would give
</I>&gt;<i> huge difference when resampling 50 Khz to a close 44.1 output freq,
</I>&gt;<i> the ratio is too close to 1 to have some really audible aliasing
</I>&gt;<i> artefacts I think).
</I>
Some Falcon games / demos that run with 50 kHz DMA sound have really,
really bad sound quality. I guess this is due to the downsampling to
44.1 kHz. So a proper sample rate convertion function could be helpful
here. So I really would not mind to add an additional autoconf test for
this.
