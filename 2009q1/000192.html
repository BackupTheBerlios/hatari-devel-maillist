<PRE>Hi,

</I>
I tested QJoyPad and it builds fine with Qt3 in Debian Lenny after
installing libxtst-dev &amp; qt3-dev-tools.

*However*, the code is pretty awful:
- it polls joysticks constantly at 1 microsecond interval
  and takes half the CPU
- it notifies itself about things with signals handlers in a way that is
  both racy and can corrupt its memory
- compiler &amp; valgrind warnings


As to rejoystick, I wrote my own Makefile and fixed several issues from
the code (took a long time to understand that it overwriting HOME
environment variable was the cause for SDL trying to initialize DirectFB
instead of X11...).   I.e. code is as bad as QJoyPad the issues just are
different, and it has some limitations compared to QJoyPad:
- hardcoded to support only first joystick
- doesn't support emulating mouse clicks or movement
  (but that's not so useful)

This is also polling constantly (AFAIK the SDL issue I've mailed earlier,
not an issue in rejoystick), but at larger interval so it doesn't take 
significantly CPU.  Constants wakeups would be bad for a laptop
battery though.

</I>&gt;<i> current Joystick button support could be remove from Hatari and manual

</I>
Both use XTest extension to fake key &amp; mouse events when Joystick stuff is
done.  I think XTest supports XInput extension[1], so it might be
theoretically possible to do joy -&gt; joy mapping, but if SDL reads joystick
directly from /dev/js* (as I think it does), even that won't work.    I.e.
I don't think it's practically possible to make these programs to do
joy button -&gt; joy movement event mapping what Matthias was after. 

Simulating keys with joystick works fine.

[1]&#160;There's no documentation on XTest, this info was from one of the Xorg
developers.

PS. I've understood that some use these programs to turn their joysticks 
into remotes...
