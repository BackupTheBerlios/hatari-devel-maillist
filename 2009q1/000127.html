Yes :) At least it's more complex than before for no audible gain :)

</I>
For me, the cleaner interface is to have the ym core (or any other sound 
generating device) outputs a buffer of samples, and then the mixer only 
have to mix array of bytes, without having to know how each byte has to be 
generated (the case of dma is a little in between, because you don't 
generate bytes, but you need to resample the buffer).

I think the cleaner interface is something like :

sample *DoMix ( sample *buffer1, int freq1 , sample *buffer2, int freq2, 
[...] , int outfreq );

That is, there's a complete abstraction of how the buffer were generated, 
and DoMix can do all kind of filtering/interpolation independantly of how 
buffers were generated.

What strange things do you mean ?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and not directly SoundRegs (which is already masked).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not a lot of bytes, but why using another copy of SoundRegs instead of

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's one copy (SoundRegs) to emulate the Ym, and one copy
</I>&gt;<i> (RecordSoundRegs) for recording .ym files.
</I>
Yes, but since they contain the same values, why not considering that the 
ym core is providing an array that can be read by other modules without 
doing another copy ?

&gt;&gt;<i> I don't know ; does it really improve sound a lot at 44.1 kHz ? I'm not

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Downsampling or upsampling to close sample rates does generate wrong

</I>
I agree, and I would say they're not that different in fact because 
resampling gfx without advanced interpolation will usually give some not 
really nice results.
