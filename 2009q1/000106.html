 Hi Kenneth!

Yes, the diff is a correct &quot;unified diff&quot;, but is has become very big.
That's quite hard to read, and you've included _all_ changes at once,
so it's a little bit difficult to track why you've changed certain
pieces of the code. For future patches, please try submit one patch for
every topic that you want to address, e.g. one patch for the GEMDOS HDD
emulation, one patch for the VC6 compatibility, etc. (and by the way,
Mercurial is a great tool to support this way of development: You check
out your private copy of the Hatari repository, then you can work on
one issue and when you're done you commit it to your local repository.
Then you can work n the next topic etc. When you finally want to submit
patches, Mercurial can generate them for you easily)

Now, let's talk about the details of your patch (sorry, I've got lots
of topics, please don't feel offended, that's just normal for Open
Source development to talk about patches!):


First, your patch tries to revert some things that have been
changed in the repository lately, e.g. video.c and wavFormat.c ... I
assume this happened because you've started your changes with Hatari
1.2.0, but then later created the diff agains the tip development
version... that's not good. For creating proper diffs, you always have
to create the diff against the version where you started your
development. So for future patches, simply always use the HG tip
version!

Then, there are the following lines in the patch:

Only in my_hatari/src: Visual.Studio
Only in my_hatari/src/includes: VisualStudioFix.c
Only in my_hatari/src/includes: VisualStudioFix.h

==&gt; You've created new files, but they are not part of the patch. You
must tell the &quot;diff&quot; command to include new files, too (with the -N
parameter).


&gt;<i> Summary of Patch:
</I>&gt;<i> -----------------
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> o Bug Fixes -
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> Corrects issues with existing GEM DOS HDD access (specific to folder
</I>&gt;<i> navigation).
</I>
Could you please separate that part of the patch from the rest of your
changes to gemdos.c, so that it is clear what is a bug fix and what is
a new feature?

&gt;<i> Updated Key Maps for English Atari Keyboards (may need to be provided
</I>&gt;<i> as a Key Mapping file?). These values can be toggled at compilation
</I>&gt;<i> time by compiler flag _ENGLISH_KEYBOARD.
</I>
Yes, that should rather go to a separate key mapping file - that's what
they are good for.

&gt;<i> o Mutliple GEM DOS HDD Support -
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i> The folder you point to to be your HDD folder will be scanned for
</I>&gt;<i> sub-folders (C, D, E etc) and each of those sub-folders will become
</I>&gt;<i> an individual GEM DOS drive unit. If you &quot;skip&quot; a drive letter (say
</I>&gt;<i> only including C and F) the intermidiate drive identifiers will be
</I>&gt;<i> free for other devices. Also, the Install Devices option in GEM works
</I>&gt;<i> accordingly.
</I>
That sounds very interesting, I need to have a closer look at this
later... I just wonder if it wouldn't be better to make the
location of the different drives fully configurable instead of mapping
them to sub-folders in one parent folder (but that's maybe much more
difficult to represent in the GUI).

&gt;<i> o Variable MHZ setting - Added functionality to allows
</I>&gt;<i> user to select a &quot;Custom&quot; MHZ processor speed up to 32768mhz.
</I>
That certainly does not work right. When nCpuFreqShift is bigger than
2, the emulator might end up in an endless loop because the new cycle
are shifted to 0.

&gt;<i> o Visual Studio 6 Compatibility - 
</I>
You've got some strange changes in there, for example:

+#if defined(__WIN32__)
 		BlitterState.have_src = true;
+#else
+		BlitterState.have_src = true;
+#endif

That seems to be nonsense. Please try to read over your patch again
before you send them in, so that this does not happen.


Then instead of doing this all over the place:

+#if !defined(__WIN32__)
+inline
+#endif

I think it would be better to #define inline somewhere in a central
header file (like config.h). I wonder why VC does not support
inline functions? I've seen some code that does a
&quot;#define inline __inline&quot; on VC6, maybe that's the trick?


Then there a lot of these:

+#if !defined(__WIN32__)
+	#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
+#endif

Instead of using &quot; #if !defined(__WIN32__) &quot; here again, it might be a
better idea to create a unistd.h file for VC6 and stick it somewhere
where only VC6 can find it (maybe in the gui-win folder?)


I'll try to incorporate some of your other changes to the repository
(e.g. the definitions of variables at the beginning of the blocks)
later, but it might take some days since I'm currently quite busy...

 Regards,
 Thomas
