<PRE>Hi,

I'll answer here to one comment in the patch tracker:
&gt;<i> * I'll scratch CPU speed selector for now (P.S. there are issues currently
</I>&gt;<i> with the existing CPU speed timing when compared to a real Falcon 
</I>&gt;<i> [based on my 32mhz falcon, my demos run about the right speed at over
</I>&gt;<i> twice the CPU rate]).
</I>
Do you mean that when you run your demo on a real Falcon
that's modified to run at 32Mhz, you had to set Hatari to
64Mhz to achive same speed with Hatari Falcon emulation?

&gt;<i> Don't know how to improve or fix this unfortunately.    
</I>
Are you using DSP?  AFAIK Hatari DSP isn't currently speed accurate
at all and missing some synchronization between Hatari &amp; DSP which
can make things quite a bit slower.

This kind of issue can happen if you do &quot;hg pull&quot; and then overwrite
the files.  You can use &quot;hg diff&quot; to see what's changed.  If Windiff
is nice UI for viewing diffs, hg can be configured to use an external
diff viewer (hg manual mentioned about that) for the &quot;hg diff&quot; command.


&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; o Visual Studio 6 Compatibility - &gt; &gt; You've got some strange
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; changes in there, for example:&gt; &gt; +#if defined(__WIN32__)&gt;

</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; true;&gt; +#endif&gt; &gt; That seems to be nonsense. Please try to read over
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; your patch again&gt; before you send them in, so that this does not
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; &gt; happen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is an error. The true should have been upper cased (Visual Studio is
</I>&gt;<i> pedantic about C, if its a C file it applies all the old style C laws
</I>&gt;<i> [like no built in type for bool]).
</I>[...]
&gt;<i>   &gt; Instead of using &quot; #if !defined(__WIN32__) &quot; here again, it might be
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt; a&gt; better idea to create a unistd.h file for VC6 and stick it
</I>&gt;<i>   &gt; somewhere&gt; where only VC6 can find it (maybe in the gui-win folder?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, right... sorry.
</I>
You could actually copy the relevant parts of all the needed C99 standard
headers to this new directory and add &quot;-I&lt;dir&gt;&quot; to the compiler flags for
VC6.

Thomas, if there are other old compilers that would need supporting, maybe
the directory should be called something like &quot;c89-compat&quot; (I don't see what
unistd.h, stdbool.h etc have to do with GUI :-)).
