<PRE>Hi,

Hatari event handling isn't very &quot;efficient&quot; in this respect.

Events are processed in Main_EventHandler() and while emulation is active,
it returns after processing single event.  It ignores other than mouse and
key events (joy.c handles then through other means than events).

Main_EventHandler() is called from IKBD_InterruptHandler_AutoSend() which is 
called at regular intervals.

Summary: events are queued and processed one at the time, *at certain
intervals*. Extra events in the queue, like joystick move events, slow down
the event processing.

We had earlier discovered that things don't work if SDL is told not to 
deliver certain kind of events, but at least for things like mouse motion
and analog joystick move events it would be more effective to process all
the available events of this kind in one go.   I think in case of mouse and
fire button presses, you would lose events if you would that.


Try the attached patch, it compresses the mouse and joystick motion events
in main loop (joy events are actually ignored).  On slow machines it should
make Hatari mouse handling more responsive (mouse pointer skips instead
of lagging).

&gt;<i> However, Xorg CPU goes up to render the moving mouse pointer
</I>&gt;<i> regardless of joystick motion. 
</I>
You mean rendering of the emulated Atari mouse pointer?

As the mouse pointer is drawn to screen, it means that emulator needs to
blit the update Atari screen contents to the X display.


&gt;<i> Note:

Thanks for reporting this!
