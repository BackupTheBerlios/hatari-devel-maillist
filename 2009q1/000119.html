Hello,

thanks for the patch ; I gave it a look, and have a few points :

  - many parts of the mixing routines for dma sound are using float and 
other math functions (ceilf, ...). I think this is a little overkill to 
use float for every sample to compute its resampled version (perhaps 
libsamplerate could do this optionnaly).

But in the normal case, we can assume 44.1 kHz for the replay freq and 50 
kHz for dma sound ; I think we can use some normal integer register to 
compute a resampling step and using '&lt;&lt; 16' for example to simulate 16 
bits of floating point (similar to the function used in sound.c to compute 
envelope step for example). 50/40 is 1.25, so even at high dma rate the 
integer part won't exceed 2 (or 6.25 when using 8kHz replay). This mean 
that we can even use '&lt;&lt; 24' to simulate 24 bits of floating point 
precision, which will certainly match the result you get with floats.

If we consider embeded/non desktop PC as Hatari's targets too, trying to 
avoid float should help maintaining performance.


  - I don't see the need for the registers history ; this looks like an 
unnecessary overhead to me. Sure, we save a buffer of (44100/50)=882 
samples, but this just means 1764 bytes at the expense of a little slower 
code (not that much I think), but a very much complex code.

As dma samples are &quot;discrete&quot; bytes, I agree that it can make sense to 
resample the dma sound on the fly depending on the replay freq.

But for the YM part, I think it's more maintainable/slighlty faster to 
&quot;loose&quot; 1.8 KB of ram and just have the ym part provides a buffer that is 
already resampled at the correct replay freq (and anyway, the 1.8 KB you 
can save this way is compensated by the history arrays used to store 
data, 3*4KB, so at the end this method also uses more ram).

When rewriting the ym sound emulation, I evaluated the idea of storing all 
ym accesses and generate one frame of sound by replaying the history 
(which is how sc68 is working too btw), but in the end, I think it adds 
complexity and requires more ram for no gain in accuracy or sound quality.

So, my &quot;vote&quot; would be to keep ym emulation simple by not adding this 
cumulative way of storing registers to replay the whole history at the 
end.

The mixing routine would just be slightly changed from :

                ymSample = Sound_NextSample();
                DmaSnd_NextSamples(&amp;dmaLeft, &amp;dmaRight);

to sthg like :

                ymSample = ymbuf[ index++ ];
                DmaSnd_NextSamples(&amp;dmaLeft, &amp;dmaRight);

where ymbuf is one &quot;vbl&quot; of ymsample as generated in the current Hatari 
version.


  - This makes sense to mix buffer in the callback. I never experienced 
sound replay problem (cpu powerful enough), but could this method have 
side effects for people using older hardware (Pentium 3) or embeded 
devices ? These less powerful machines are quite sensitive sometimes :)


&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now i need to fix sound recording (storing the mixed samples in a buffer), 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and i need to test and improve the ym registers history, when a software is 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> abusing the ym registers, it might overflow the history.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The next steps are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - fix sound recording (quite easy)
</I>
Why do you use RecordSoundRegs in Sound_WriteReg

        RecordSoundRegs[reg] = data &amp; SoundRegsMask[reg];

and not directly SoundRegs (which is already masked).

Not a lot of bytes, but why using another copy of SoundRegs instead of 
referencing it directly in the record functions as today ?


&gt;&gt;<i> - handle history overflow (need to write a test program)
</I>
Although I appreciate the work, this is where I think the history method 
is not needed. The extra complexity needs some testing scenario to be sure 
no sound regression won't happen. Writing the current &quot;direct&quot; way of 
mixing already took a lot of time to check sound was as precise as 
possible, so changing it again doesn't sound a good idea to me (and this 
won't improve sound quality, at best the quality will just be the same 
as today with the history method).


&gt;&gt;<i> - improve the dma resampling and filtering (not too hard)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - implement LMC sound filters (the good things for the end, always)
</I>
sc68 has some starting point for this if I recall, unless there's some 
proper docs somewhere detailing the filters applied ?

&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The patch has been exported by 'hg export' and can be imported by 'hg 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> import'.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> JB
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PS: about 'improve the dma resampling', maybe *optionally* with a configure 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flag we could use libsamplerate ?
</I>
I don't know ; does it really improve sound a lot at 44.1 kHz ? I'm not 
sure the real problem to get a sound really close to dma is resampling, 
but more in the modeling of filters that match the original 1 kohm 
resistance between the sound chip and the left/right output for instance.

Thomas's policy was to keep dependancies at the minimum to allow 
compilation on as much system (including the &quot;broken&quot; ones), but perhaps 
that if the code is made optional with configure this could be used (but 
once again, I'm not sure that libresample would give huge difference when 
resampling 50 Khz to a close 44.1 output freq, the ratio is too close to 1 
to have some really audible aliasing artefacts I think).


Thanks for you work :)
