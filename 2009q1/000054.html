That was also my first thought, but actually it was me who introduced
the bug with changeset 5d29291777ec (and my current bug fix mainly
reverts that patch).

&gt;<i> Is this bad enough to warrant Hatari v1.3 (as you've already added
</I>&gt;<i> midi in/through and IDE disk features) soonish?
</I>
Yes, I think we urgently should publish a new version with that fix,
since this can really cause ugly data losses... let's target next
weekend, would that be OK for everybody?

&gt;<i> Is there a similar problem with HD images (something buffered that
</I>&gt;<i> would need to be flushed from Hatari or TOS before emulation is
</I>&gt;<i> rebooted to prevent corrupting the image)?
</I>
No, HD images are not buffered like the floppy disk images, so there
shouldn't be any more problems.

 Thomas
