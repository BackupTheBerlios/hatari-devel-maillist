Matthias, doing proper patches by separating independent changes is
_always_ a good idea. As soon as there's a regression bug somewhere, a
proper change history is elementary. And by the way, it's no big deal
with Mercurial - you simply commit all independent changes to your local
repository first and when you're done with all your changes, you can
push them to the server.

Then, I'd like to ask you to adapt the coding style of the files that
you are changing. For example you've indented with spaces instead of
tabs... that looks very ugly as soon as you use a tab with other than 8.

&gt;<i> One thing came to mind though (which I didn't want to change yet).
</I>&gt;<i> The code for joystick button 2 seems to available for ST joystick 1
</I>&gt;<i> only. Would it make sense to open this for others too or is there a
</I>&gt;<i> very specific reason why this is locked to ST joystick 1?
</I>
Concerning the spacebar emulation, this certainly does not make much
sense for the other joysticks - why should more than one player press
space on a real ST?
And for the STE/Jaguar joypad emulation, your joystick button remap code
might be even wrong since the Jaguar joypads have more than one button!
So I suggest to remove this options from all joysticks except joystick
1 again.

 Thomas
