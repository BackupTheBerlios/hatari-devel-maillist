<PRE>Hi,

Will do next week...


&gt;<i> &gt; I've tried this with:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; $ socat -b1 PIPE:hatari1.pipe  PIPE:hatari2.pipe &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; $&#160;hatari --midi hatari1.pipe &amp;

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That does not seem to work because socat seems to echo the characters
</I>&gt;<i> in PIPE-mode when one end is opened in both, read and write mode.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But you can do the following - it works for me:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> socat PTY,raw,echo=0,link=/tmp/midi1 PTY,raw,echo=0,link=/tmp/midi2
</I>&gt;<i> hatari --midi /tmp/midi1 &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> hatari --midi /tmp/midi2 &amp;
</I>
Great, thanks, I'll add this to the alsa-midi.txt networking section.


&gt;<i> &gt; And with:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; $ socat -b1 -v -x PIPE:hatari1-out.pipe PIPE:hatari2-in.pipe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; $ socat -b1 -v -x PIPE:hatari2-out.pipe PIPE:hatari1-in.pipe
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; $&#160;hatari &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; $&#160;hatari &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (and connecting the midi I/O appropriately.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That could work, but you then could also use two normal named pipes
</I>&gt;<i> instead, which you can create with the &quot;mkfifo&quot; command. 
</I>
It's not quite the same.

From &quot;fifo&quot; manual:
	The FIFO must be opened on both ends (reading and writing) before data
	can be  passed.   Normally, opening the FIFO blocks until the other end is
	opened also.

I.e. The Hatari instances should open the fifos in same order, but because
both open the output one first, I think they would deadlock.


&gt;<i> &gt; PS. Midi_Init seems to be called only at startup, from main.c, not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; after changing the files from the internal GUI.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, thanks for the hint, that's fixed now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And from command line one cannot give separate input and output
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; files (needed for making a midi ring?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That could be useful, can you add such options?
</I>&gt;<i> Shall the normal --midi option then be removed?
</I>
Well, we could leave --midi work like now for convenience and add
--midi-in for setting the input file name if it needs to be separate
(i.e. it would need to be given after --midi is set). 

I guess same should them be done for RS232, --rs232 would set both
input and output files and --rs232-in would overide just the input side.

Would that make sense?


&gt;<i> &gt; Midi_Init() has also minor issue that it:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; - doesn't check whether filename is empty before trying to open
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   MIDI in/out
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Shouldn't that rather be handled by File_Open instead (which then
</I>&gt;<i> should return a NULL pointer)?
</I>
In the case midi file name is empty, it shouldn't be tried to be opened.

If there's an error (NULL) returned by Midi I/O file open, user should
be notified with a dialog. I can add that.

(&quot;/dev/snd/midiC1D0&quot; being used for default midi file names isn't a problem
because MIDI is disabled by default.  If user enables MIDI, he should
correct the file names too.)


&gt;<i> &gt; - it disables midi if either in or out file opening fails
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I.e. both need to have valid filenames or Midi's disabled.  I don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think it's so serious that Midi input opening fails.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, right, you might have a MIDI device which is output only, too.
</I>&gt;<i> I've changed the code now so that failures here are not considered as
</I>&gt;<i> fatal anymore.
</I>
Thanks!
