<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> I agree we can't synchronize sdl callback and vbl ; the callback will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ask for 1024 samples in current implementation, while a vbl is 882
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> samples at 44.1 kHz, which looks not enough.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So the idea is to always have sample in advance, which is how
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Sound_Reset is doing by faking the value of nGeneratedSamples on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first run.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, right, and as far as I know this worked quite well for everybody
</I>&gt;<i> (or did you really hear something wrong with the current
</I>&gt;<i> implementation?).
</I>
Well recently i've complained about dma/ym mixing, that's why i've started
to look inside the code, for me it's more reliable than my ears, you know,
too much sony's walkman when i was young :)

&gt;<i> Another thing I'd like to talk about is the .WAV file recording. I
</I>&gt;<i> think there might be a problem with your new implementation,
</I>&gt;<i> Tob&#195;&#169;... with the current implementation, Hatari always generates
</I>&gt;<i> exactly the same amount of samples during a certain amount of VBLs.
</I>&gt;<i> With your new implementation the amount of samples might vary (for
</I>&gt;<i> example when the main thread is delayed a little bit, the sound thread
</I>&gt;<i> might generate more samples compared to the amount of VBLs that have
</I>&gt;<i> been rendered).
</I>&gt;<i> When you are now recording screen snapshots and .WAV file at the same
</I>&gt;<i> time, e.g. to merge them later into a video clip (I did this some times
</I>&gt;<i> in the past already), you can hardly synchronize the audio and video
</I>&gt;<i> anymore, because the amount of samples in the .WAV file does not match
</I>&gt;<i> the amount of VBLs anymore...
</I>
Ah yes that's another problem :/

Well, at least i'm not wasting my time, now i have a better understanding
of the audio processing inside hatari. I may have found a problem with dma
sounds with protracker STE (i don't have the version handy, i'm working
right now :p), but first i need to make sure i was running an unmodified
version of hatari.

I still need a better implementation, because i can't work on our demo
under hatari. I can't send some examples of my problems right now but the
demo will be release next month (or later :)).

Thanks,
JB
