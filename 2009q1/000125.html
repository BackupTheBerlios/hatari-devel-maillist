<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i>   - many parts of the mixing routines for dma sound are using float and 
</I>&gt;<i> other math functions (ceilf, ...). I think this is a little overkill to 
</I>&gt;<i> use float for every sample to compute its resampled version (perhaps 
</I>&gt;<i> libsamplerate could do this optionnaly).
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> If we consider embeded/non desktop PC as Hatari's targets too, trying to 
</I>&gt;<i> avoid float should help maintaining performance.
</I>
Yes actually it's just a fast an naive implementation, i should have 
mentioned this. Of course i'll write a fast linear interpolation.

&gt;<i>   - I don't see the need for the registers history ; this looks like an 
</I>&gt;<i> unnecessary overhead to me. Sure, we save a buffer of (44100/50)=882 
</I>&gt;<i> samples, but this just means 1764 bytes at the expense of a little slower 
</I>&gt;<i> code (not that much I think), but a very much complex code.
</I> &gt; [...]
&gt;<i> So, my &quot;vote&quot; would be to keep ym emulation simple by not adding this 
</I>&gt;<i> cumulative way of storing registers to replay the whole history at the 
</I>&gt;<i> end.
</I>
Do you really thing the code is that comlex ? :)
I find the interface between Ym emulation and the mixer far cleaner now, 
the old version was doing some strange things.

&gt;<i>   - This makes sense to mix buffer in the callback. I never experienced 
</I>&gt;<i> sound replay problem (cpu powerful enough), but could this method have 
</I>&gt;<i> side effects for people using older hardware (Pentium 3) or embeded 
</I>&gt;<i> devices ? These less powerful machines are quite sensitive sometimes :)
</I>
I'll do some profiling.

&gt;<i> Why do you use RecordSoundRegs in Sound_WriteReg
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>         RecordSoundRegs[reg] = data &amp; SoundRegsMask[reg];
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> and not directly SoundRegs (which is already masked).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not a lot of bytes, but why using another copy of SoundRegs instead of 
</I>&gt;<i> referencing it directly in the record functions as today ?
</I>
There's one copy (SoundRegs) to emulate the Ym, and one copy 
(RecordSoundRegs) for recording .ym files.

&gt;<i> I don't know ; does it really improve sound a lot at 44.1 kHz ? I'm not 
</I>&gt;<i> sure the real problem to get a sound really close to dma is resampling, 
</I>&gt;<i> but more in the modeling of filters that match the original 1 kohm 
</I>&gt;<i> resistance between the sound chip and the left/right output for instance.
</I>
Downsampling or upsampling to close sample rates does generate wrong 
frequencies. Audio resampling is far different than bitmap resampling.

Thanks,
JB
