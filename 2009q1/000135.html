Yes, right, and as far as I know this worked quite well for everybody
(or did you really hear something wrong with the current
implementation?).

Another thing I'd like to talk about is the .WAV file recording. I
think there might be a problem with your new implementation,
Tob&#233;... with the current implementation, Hatari always generates
exactly the same amount of samples during a certain amount of VBLs.
With your new implementation the amount of samples might vary (for
example when the main thread is delayed a little bit, the sound thread
might generate more samples compared to the amount of VBLs that have
been rendered).
When you are now recording screen snapshots and .WAV file at the same
time, e.g. to merge them later into a video clip (I did this some times
in the past already), you can hardly synchronize the audio and video
anymore, because the amount of samples in the .WAV file does not match
the amount of VBLs anymore...
