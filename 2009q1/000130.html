<PRE>Wow that's a lots of mails :)

First point, about performances, remember we are talking about sounds 
processing. At the best quality, 44100 Hz 16 bits stereo, we only have 
to process 441000 * 2 * 2 = 176400 bytes per seconds. Sure it needs to 
be optimized (like everything in a realtime application) but i don't 
think this is the 'primary target'.
I'll dump some profiling informations soon, you can do the same on your 
side and then we can study the results and know what eats up CPU, and 
what needs to be optimized for slower platforms.

Second point, about DMA samples interpolation, as i said before, i'll 
start to implement this for real in the next step, after fixing wav and 
ym recording (done). The new implementation is quite lame (the current 
too :)). Let's talk about this later.

Third point, the new implementation vs the current one. Correct me if 
i'm wrong:

In the current implementation:
Ym samples are generated when:
   - an ym register is written - from the last time a register was 
written to the current time - then the register is changed.
   - at each VBL - from the last time a register was written to the 
current time.

If a SDL audio callback occurs between two ym register write access, or 
between an ym register write access and a VBL, the samples between the 
last time and the current time are missing.

As far as i know, there's no way to synchronize the SDL audio callback 
and the VBL, for this we need direct access to the primary buffer.

In the new implementation, the last ym register write access is the last 
history event stored. Samples are generated even after the last event.

Cheers,
JB
