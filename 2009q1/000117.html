<PRE>Hello,

Here is a patch that affects sound emulation and mixing.
This is work in progress, it needs some cleanup, fixes and improvements.

I'm sending it for reviews, suggestions, tests and complete rejection :)

This is a quite large path sorry.

Commit message:
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Change the sound generation and mixing procedures.
+ Ym and Dma emulation are no longer dependant.
+ Samples are generated on demand when the SDL audio callback is triggered.
+ Mixing occurs in the SDL audio callback.
+ No more desync between SDL buffer and mixing buffer (no more mixing 
buffer btw)
+ The SDL audio buffer size is frequency dependant (and small).
+ Dma samples are generated via linear interpolation (still not the best 
method).
+ Sound is paused when exit confirmation is displayed.
+ Added some 4 pole filters (configurable).
- Sound recording is broken (i'll fix it asap).
- Ym register history can overflow.
&quot;&quot;&quot;

Note the two last lines :)

One of the most important change is the way samples are generated in the 
Ym emulation:

- Now, when a ym register is written, the affected sample number is 
computed and the change is stored in a list.
When the SDL audio callback needs samples, it calls the ym emulation, 
and the ym emulation replay the history and generate the samples.

- The Dma sound generation is done the same way. The SDL audio callback 
ask some samples to the Dma emulation (but there's no history).

This way, the ym and dma emulation are two independent things.

The mixing is done in the SDL audio callback, and everything related to 
mixing was moved in audio.c (sound.c is for ym things only and dmasnd.c 
is for dma things only).

Now i need to fix sound recording (storing the mixed samples in a 
buffer), and i need to test and improve the ym registers history, when a 
software is abusing the ym registers, it might overflow the history.

The next steps are:
- fix sound recording (quite easy)
- handle history overflow (need to write a test program)
- improve the dma resampling and filtering (not too hard)
- implement LMC sound filters (the good things for the end, always)

The patch has been exported by 'hg export' and can be imported by 'hg 
import'.

Cheers,
JB

PS: about 'improve the dma resampling', maybe *optionally* with a 
configure flag we could use libsamplerate ?
