No, that could only work worse, I think. Image that somebody changes
the disk image completely or even deletes or renames the file - the the
memory snapshot would become useless!

&gt;<i> Btw. If one were to implement saving also to disk images within ZIP
</I>&gt;<i> files, then also the ZipPath would need to be stored along with disk
</I>&gt;<i> path.  IMHO it would be better to remove whole ZIP support though as
</I>&gt;<i> it significantly complicates the file selector / disk image handling
</I>&gt;<i> and is incomplete.  Does somebody use Zip files?
</I>
Well, I is this feature almost continuesly. Half of my disk image
collection is ZIPped. I guess most other people also use this since
most disk images that can be found on the internet are ZIPped. So there
is certainly no point in removing this feature!

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Is this bad enough to warrant Hatari v1.3 (as you've already added
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; midi in/through and IDE disk features) soonish?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, I think we urgently should publish a new version with that fix,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; since this can really cause ugly data losses... let's target next
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; weekend, would that be OK for everybody?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would one week more be too much?  Have all the changes done so far
</I>&gt;<i> already been tested properly &amp; stabilized?
</I>
Since that disk image bug is really critical (you can loose data!), I
think we should publish a new version as soon as possible. If there are
then any problems left, we still can do a patch-level release (1.2.1)
later.
