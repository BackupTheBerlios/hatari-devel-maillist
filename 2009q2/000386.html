<PRE>Hello,

I've started to look at the new debugger, it really a great work, thank you.

&gt;<i> I mean, with DSP addresses, you need also to specify which memory space
</I>&gt;<i> it belongs to.  It could be specified e.g. as &quot;x$200&quot;, &quot;$x200&quot;, &quot;$200x&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But the main thing is about what to do with the indirect addressing, how
</I>&gt;<i> it's determined into which memory space a register points into?  Is it based
</I>&gt;<i> on what register is used or some other information?  Or would you (also)
</I>&gt;<i> need to be able to specify it in the breakpoint e.g. like in:
</I>&gt;<i> 	(x0/p).w &amp; 3 = $200&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> ?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>DSP and 68030 works differently. There's no &quot;indirect adressing mode&quot; in 
DSP.

A register can't be relative like A0-A7 registers in 68030. They only 
contain a value.

You can't access to a memory with X0, X1, Y0, Y1, A, B, M0-M7, N0-N7.

But memory can be accessed relatively with R0-R7.

In DSP, you can adress memory in 4 different ways :

Word access (24 bits) :

X:ea   Y:ea   P:ea  (effective addressing mode)
X:aa   Y:aa   P:aa  (absolute addressing mode)

Long word access (48 bits) :

L:ea
L:aa

ea represent any of (R0-R7) registers, in all the modes (R0+N0), 
(R0)+N0, (R0+), ...
ea can also be an absolute long address (x:$1234, ...) or an immediate 
value (no memory access here)

aa is an immediate address. this address is generally a short address.

In X, Y, P mode, you only access to a  single word memory address (24 bits)

In L memory access  mode, you access simultaneously to X and Y memory 
(48 bits long word)

Some examples :

x:$12
x:123a
y:(R4)-

l:(R0)
l:$abcd

&gt;<i> (x0/p).w &amp; 3 = $200&quot;
</I>
The .w means nothing in DSP, as you always access to DSP memory 
(internal or external) in word size (24 bits).
First address is a $0, next one at $1, ...


&gt;<i> If memory space needs to be explicitly specified in indirect register
</I>&gt;<i> addressing, then there needs to be some separator for the address space
</I>&gt;<i> like '/' above.  I would use it them also in addresses like in &quot;x/$200&quot;..
</I>
I thing &quot;:&quot; would look closer to DSP writing convention if it is 
possible to use them.

Regards

Laurent

Ps : I'm really busy for work this week, I'll have more time next week 
to have a look at all of this.
But if you have more questions, don't hesitate to ask them.
