<PRE>Hi,

On Saturday 06 June 2009, <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/hatari-devel">npomarede at corp.free.fr</A> wrote:
&gt;<i> &gt; Btw. I thought a bit more about the register value conditions on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; breakpoints and they could actually be doable.  debugui.c could parse
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the condition string given to breakpoint or single step command:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	db &lt;address&gt; [
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 		&lt;register&gt; &lt;comparison&gt; &lt;value&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 		[ | &lt;register&gt; &lt;comparison&gt; &lt;value&gt; ]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 		[ &amp; &lt;register&gt; &lt;comparison&gt; &lt;value&gt; ]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	]
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; where condition could be one of these:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	&lt;, &gt;, =, !
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like in:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	db 01b4 A1 &gt; 1000 &amp; D0 = 20
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's the idea I had when thinking about the 68000 breakpoints.
</I>&gt;<i> Possible extensions I saw were also :
</I>&gt;<i>   - add a .b .w .l suffix after the register name to limit the size
</I>&gt;<i>     of the comparison.
</I>
Sounds fine.  The support for this can be used internally also in DSP emu
when matching PC (16-bit) instead of the other registers (32-bit).


&gt;<i>   - use the () syntax as in 68000 to indicate &quot;read the memory pointed by
</I>&gt;<i>     this register/address&quot;
</I>
This starts to make parsing pretty complicated...  I think at least these
should be separated by spaces from anything else.  Like this:
	( a0 ) .w = ffff | ( d0 ) .b &amp; 1 = 1


&gt;<i>   - in your db example, don't specify an address, but make it optional by
</I>&gt;<i>     using a more generic approach using the name 'pc' ; so setting a
</I>&gt;<i>     breakpoint would not be &quot;db &lt;addr&gt;&quot; but &quot;db pc=&lt;addr&gt;&quot;
</I>
I like this because it gets rid of the separate single stepping debugger
command and boolean.  Single stepping would then be just a condition for:
	pc = pc

And clearing breakpoint(s) could then be done with just:
	db

If one wants multiple breakpoints, they would need to be given by ORing
the conditions:
	pc = 575443 ||&#160;pc 345567


&gt;<i>   - use the '&amp;' to apply an optionnal mask before doing the comparison
</I>
Only on the left side?

If it's allowed only on the left side, it's easier for parser to catch
mistakes between bitwise and boolean AND.

Or maybe we only need bitwise AND and boolean OR?  That would be even
clearer.


&gt;<i> The syntax I was thinking about would allow things like :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> pc=$1200  : stop when pc=$1200 (before executing the instruction at
</I>&gt;<i> $1200)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (a0)=32 : stop when the 32 bits pointed by a0 contain the value 32
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ($ff820a).b = 2 : stop when the byte stored at address $ff820a=2
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ($ff8260).b &amp; 3 = 1 : stop when the byte stored at address $ff8260,
</I>&gt;<i> masked with a binary &quot;and 3&quot; is 1 -&gt; useful to stop when the resolution
</I>&gt;<i> is changed, as only bit 0 and 1 of $ff8260 have a meaning on STF/E.
</I>
The current debugger understands all addresses as hex already so '$' is 
superfluous.  Maybe all values should always be interpreted as hex?


&gt;<i> (a1).w = d1 : stop if the 16 bits pointed by a0 are the same as the 16
</I>&gt;<i> lower bits of register d0.
</I>
So the mask should affect both sides?  Wouldn't it be more logical
for the comparison operation then?
  ( a1 ) =w d1
?


&gt;<i> This means we would have some reserved word (=regs)that should be
</I>&gt;<i> interpreted as 68000 registers, not as some hexa values : a0 to a7, d0 to
</I>&gt;<i> d7, pc, ssp, ..., + more for dsp reg.
</I>
The register parsing should probably be separate for DSP and m68k as it
needs getting pointers to registers within CPU/DSP structs, knowing their
sizes etc.  Parsing would be separate from matching the parsed conditions.

I can try to experiment a bit with the parsing &amp; matching code for DSP later
(goes probably to next week).


&gt;<i> A breakpoint &quot;unit&quot; would be :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;value&gt; &lt;comparison&gt; &lt;value&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> where &lt;value&gt; could be
</I>&gt;<i>    regs[.size] [&amp;mask]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> | (regs)[.size] [&amp;mask]
</I>&gt;<i> | constant[.size]
</I>&gt;<i> | (constant)[.size]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then as you suggest, we should be able to &quot;chain&quot; many units with &quot;and&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> or &quot;or&quot; to have a more complex condition for the final breakpoint.
</I>
Do you see a real use for AND chaining?


&gt;<i> Based on the skeleton code you wrote, I think this could be quite
</I>&gt;<i> feasible with a little extra work, and would give a very good
</I>&gt;<i> flexibility.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then we should be able to have many breakpoints at the same time, each
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoint being the combination of one or more condition.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This means we would have a linked list (or a limited size array, that's
</I>&gt;<i> easier to handle) of max N breakpoints, each entry would contain a
</I>&gt;<i> structure describing one breakpoint (a breakpoint could be a combination
</I>&gt;<i> of many conditions with &quot;or&quot; or &quot;and&quot;)
</I>
Array is also faster.


&gt;<i> If breakpoint mode is set during execution, then we should scan the N
</I>&gt;<i> entries of the main breakpoints table to see if a breakpoint matches. As
</I>&gt;<i> soon as a match is found, we call DebugUI.
</I>
