<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; Btw.  What do you think of the issue of multiple breakpoints vs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; multiple break conditions?
</I>
Btw.  I was thinking that the conditional breakpoint checking will
be quite a bit slower than normal address based breakpoints, so
maybe we should have both?

I.e. both CPU &amp; DSP could both be:
- single-stepped
- have separate (fast) address breakpoints
- have separate (slow) conditional breakpoints


The debugger syntax would be following:

a - list address breakpoints
a &lt;address&gt; -&#160;toggle breakpoint at given address

b - list conditional breakpoints
b &lt;index&gt; - remove given conditional breakpoint (and list remaining?)
b &lt;condition&gt; - add conditional breakpoint

c [steps] - continue execution (for 'steps' instructions)

 (I'd like to change 'b' shortcut to 'conditional breakpoint' as 'c'
shortcut was already reserved and 'a' was free for 'breakpoint address'.)

DSP debugging shorcuts would just add 'd' into beginning.


&gt;<i> &gt; Ok.  Attached is a start on conditional breakpoint handling.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Handling of different addressing modes did / will make the code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a bit bloated.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nice code, thanks for doing this so rapidly.
</I>
I'll add it to repo under name breakcond.c so that you can track  it
easier.  After it's about ready, I will look into (I think fairly small)
changes required to debugui.c/dsp.c/Makefile for integrating it.

(If the code's not satisfactory for Thomas, single extra .c file is easy
to remove. :-))


&gt;<i> I haven't tested it yet, but just looking at the way you handle multiple
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoints, why storing the conditions &quot;flat&quot; in static bp_condition_t
</I>&gt;<i> BreakConditions[16] with the help of BP_NEXT_NEW to mark the end of a
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoint ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This seems a little difficult then to directly access breakpoint Nbr 5
</I>&gt;<i> for example,
</I>
The breakpoint manipulation for user doesn't matter speedwise, but
checking functionality called for every instruction does.  I was thinking
that it would be faster to check if it's all in one array (and it saves
trivial amount of memory ;-)).


&gt;<i> and if you remove it, you have to rearrange BreakConditions[].
</I>
Also with array of arrays you need to do memmove().


&gt;<i> What about this structure to store breakpoints consisting of optionnaly
</I>&gt;<i> many conditions :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> #define MAX_BREAKPOINTS 16
</I>&gt;<i> #define MAX_COND_PER_BREAKPOINT 6
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> structure BreakPoint {
</I>&gt;<i> bp_condition_t BreakPointConditions[ MAX_COND_PER_BREAKPOINT ];
</I>&gt;<i> int NbConditions;
</I>&gt;<i> }
</I>&gt;<i> CpuBreakPoint[ MAX_BREAKPOINTS ];
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This way access to a given breakpoint is faster,
</I>
In the CPU/DSP mainloop where the speed matters, you need to go through
all of the breakpoints (but not necessarily through all conditions).

I think whether array of arrays or a single array is faster depends on do
you have more separate breakpoints (with array of arrays you have more
code to go through in this case) or conditions with AND booleans
(with single array you need to scan forward).


&gt;<i> and if you remove one 
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoint, just set NbConditions to 0 to ignore this entry.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think ? (just a suggestion, as you propose some code I don't
</I>&gt;<i> want to impose my view :) )
</I>
I need to think about this a bit more when I add the breakpoint listing
and removal functionality.
