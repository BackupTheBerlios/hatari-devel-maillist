Btw.  For a while I suspected fast forwarding as I remember earlier noticing
some TOS version sometimes freezing when using (or was it toggling?)
fast-forward during bootup and I think I've had sometimes issues with
it otherwise too.

Only things where fast-forward can have an affect are:
1. key repeat (effect configurable)
2. toggling back to normal speed calls Sound_ResetBufferIndex()
3. allowing emulation go faster than system clock. System clock
    i.e. &quot;time(NULL)&quot; call is used in rtc.c and ikbc.c

1) or 2) cannot affect what happens within emulation, they should affect
only emulator.  3) could have an effect.

Unlike ST/STe/TT tables, ioMemTabFalcon.c doesn't seem to hook RTC
functions, so that shouldn't[1] affect this either.  That leaves
IKBD_Cmd_ReadClock() call, but according to &quot;--trace ikbd_cmds&quot;,
Built-in Obsolescence doesn't call that either.

[1] Thomas any comment on this?


        - Eero

PS.  If speeding fast-forwarding emulation could actually make things not
to work due to timings changing, so could emulation running at less than
100% speed because it's too slow...
