Not yet, but I started to look into this DSP debugging thing Laurent
suggested and though that dumping certain things always when invoking
the debugger might be useful.

I guess doing the other changes but leaving the calls to output functions
commented out (and adding the DSP stubs) would be fine?

One can then easily enable the line(s) for whather output he wants manually
and re-compile Hatari.  Only annoying thing is that pressing the debugger
key (Pause) again in Hatari window wouldn't continue the emulation after
this info is dumped.  One needs to type &quot;c&quot; in console.

Or maybe there should be a separate debug mode that would just dump the info
and then continue emulation?  (then -D could take an argument for what it
dumps whenever debugger key is pressed)
