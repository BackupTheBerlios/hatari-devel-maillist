</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's the idea I had when thinking about the 68000 breakpoints.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Possible extensions I saw were also :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   - add a .b .w .l suffix after the register name to limit the size
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     of the comparison.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds fine.  The support for this can be used internally also in DSP emu
</I>&gt;<i> when matching PC (16-bit) instead of the other registers (32-bit).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   - use the () syntax as in 68000 to indicate &quot;read the memory pointed by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     this register/address&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This starts to make parsing pretty complicated...  I think at least these
</I>&gt;<i> should be separated by spaces from anything else.  Like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 	( a0 ) .w = ffff | ( d0 ) .b &amp; 1 = 1
</I>
I don't really like the spaces ; at least I think it should be possible to 
use them or not, but for the parser, all spaces should be removed as I 
don't see why adding () would bring ambiguity ?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   - in your db example, don't specify an address, but make it optional by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     using a more generic approach using the name 'pc' ; so setting a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     breakpoint would not be &quot;db &lt;addr&gt;&quot; but &quot;db pc=&lt;addr&gt;&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like this because it gets rid of the separate single stepping debugger
</I>&gt;<i> command and boolean.  Single stepping would then be just a condition for:
</I>&gt;<i> 	pc = pc
</I>
You seldom starts the emulator with single stepping, this would single 
step at the start of the ROM and would have no real interest.
In my experience, you first set a breakpoint at a given pc  (and in that 
case we could accept the syntax 'db &lt;addr&gt;' as equivalent to 'db 
pc=&lt;addr&gt;'). When the pc is reached, the debugger is called and then you 
use a different key to single step (for example 'z').

But as I see it, I don't think that single stepping should be made with a 
breakpoint ; it should just be a flag that calls the debugger each time an 
instruction was executed.

&gt;<i> And clearing breakpoint(s) could then be done with just:
</I>&gt;<i> 	db
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If one wants multiple breakpoints, they would need to be given by ORing
</I>&gt;<i> the conditions:
</I>&gt;<i> 	pc = 575443 ||&#160;pc 345567
</I>
I think we could have a command 'bl' that lists all breakpoint with its 
index number.

Then we could have a command 'br' to remove one specific breakpoint from 
the list (and optionally reorder all index numbers)

Then a command 'b' (or whatever) to add a new breakpoint at the end of the 
list/array.

If I recall these were the commands available under Amiga Mon by Timo 
Rossi, a very powerful monitor under amiga.

But the syntax you propose with || or &amp;&amp; would be more useful to me to 
define a single breakpoint consisting of several conditions.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>   - use the '&amp;' to apply an optionnal mask before doing the comparison
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Only on the left side?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it's allowed only on the left side, it's easier for parser to catch
</I>&gt;<i> mistakes between bitwise and boolean AND.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or maybe we only need bitwise AND and boolean OR?  That would be even
</I>&gt;<i> clearer.
</I>
Only the left side should be enough. I think we need boolean AND, so maybe 
using '&amp;' and '&amp;&amp;' is enough to separate bitwise/boolean meaning ?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The syntax I was thinking about would allow things like :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pc=$1200  : stop when pc=$1200 (before executing the instruction at
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> $1200)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (a0)=32 : stop when the 32 bits pointed by a0 contain the value 32
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ($ff820a).b = 2 : stop when the byte stored at address $ff820a=2
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ($ff8260).b &amp; 3 = 1 : stop when the byte stored at address $ff8260,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> masked with a binary &quot;and 3&quot; is 1 -&gt; useful to stop when the resolution
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is changed, as only bit 0 and 1 of $ff8260 have a meaning on STF/E.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current debugger understands all addresses as hex already so '$' is
</I>&gt;<i> superfluous.  Maybe all values should always be interpreted as hex?
</I>
Well, I wonder if defaulting to hex is a good idea in the end ? I know 
it's the current mode, but as we plan to improve the debugger, perhaps we 
should change this ?
I think that default to decimal and adding '$' for hex is better, and 
could also allow '%' for binary latter for example.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (a1).w = d1 : stop if the 16 bits pointed by a0 are the same as the 16
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> lower bits of register d0.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So the mask should affect both sides?  Wouldn't it be more logical
</I>&gt;<i> for the comparison operation then?
</I>&gt;<i>  ( a1 ) =w d1
</I>&gt;<i> ?
</I>
I would say we use the smallest mask of both side, so (a1).w=d1.b would 
compare only 8 bits. I find the =w a little strange to read ; I think 
adding .b .w .l after the register is closer to what a 68000 coder would 
use when coding in asm.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This means we would have some reserved word (=regs)that should be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> interpreted as 68000 registers, not as some hexa values : a0 to a7, d0 to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> d7, pc, ssp, ..., + more for dsp reg.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The register parsing should probably be separate for DSP and m68k as it
</I>&gt;<i> needs getting pointers to registers within CPU/DSP structs, knowing their
</I>&gt;<i> sizes etc.  Parsing would be separate from matching the parsed conditions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I can try to experiment a bit with the parsing &amp; matching code for DSP later
</I>&gt;<i> (goes probably to next week).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A breakpoint &quot;unit&quot; would be :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &lt;value&gt; &lt;comparison&gt; &lt;value&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> where &lt;value&gt; could be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    regs[.size] [&amp;mask]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> | (regs)[.size] [&amp;mask]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> | constant[.size]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> | (constant)[.size]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then as you suggest, we should be able to &quot;chain&quot; many units with &quot;and&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or &quot;or&quot; to have a more complex condition for the final breakpoint.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you see a real use for AND chaining?
</I>
Yes, for example stop at a given PC, but only after a number of iterations 
was made :
pc=$1234 &amp;&amp; d0=45

Or stop at a given PC when it changed the color to $700 :
pc=$1234 &amp;&amp; ($ff8240).w=$700

But the logical OR chaining is less useful, as it could be done with 
another different breakpoint.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Based on the skeleton code you wrote, I think this could be quite
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> feasible with a little extra work, and would give a very good
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> flexibility.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then we should be able to have many breakpoints at the same time, each
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> breakpoint being the combination of one or more condition.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This means we would have a linked list (or a limited size array, that's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easier to handle) of max N breakpoints, each entry would contain a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> structure describing one breakpoint (a breakpoint could be a combination
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of many conditions with &quot;or&quot; or &quot;and&quot;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Array is also faster.
</I>
Yes, and I think we can have a hard limit like 50 or so for the array size 
to avoid dynamic resizing or things like that. I think having 
dynamic memory allocation for breakpoint is a little overkill
