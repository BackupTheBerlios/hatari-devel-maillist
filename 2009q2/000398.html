<PRE>

Hello,

2 months ago I started a partial rewrite of video.c inner work in order to 
better support some shifter effects. Due to few spare time, it took me 
some times to finish and test fully, but I think current version is now OK 
to be included in the devel tree.

Short description :
-------------------

This version now supports mixing video lines of different frequencies and 
resolutions while still being able to correctly compute the video address 
used to synchronize with the shifter.

This fixes the following demos :
  - TEX screen in Syntax Terror
  - D.I. No Shit screen in Mind Bomb by The Lost Boys
  - TCB fullscreen in Swedish New Year I (one of my favorite, very simple,
    but &quot;shocking&quot; at its time). Hatari seems to be the only emu to run it.
  - pompey pirates menu 88
  - SHFORSTV.EXE by Paulo Simoes (including the fastest syncscroll
    routines for STF), also an Hatari &quot;exclusive&quot; one.

As well as many changes to timings that should give closer results to what 
a real shifter is doing when changing freq between 50 and 60 Hz.

I really tested dozens of demos at different stages to avoid all possible 
regressions, and hopefully I fixed all the ones I found.

But more tests are needed, so don't hesitate to boot your favorite 
demos/games and to report any changes you could see (although games are 
less likely to be affected as they rarely used advanced shifter effects).


Long description :
------------------

This is a more detailled technical explanation on what was changed.

The main problem when changing freq between 50 and 60 Hz is that depending 
on when you change freq, the resulting line will be 512 cycles or 508 
cycles.

The problem is that to compute video line / position we used :
  line = cycle_since_vbl / cycle_per_line
  pos = cycle_since_vbl % cycle_per_line

This requires cycle_per_line to be constant during a whole VBL, but as 
some demos switch to 60 Hz during 2 or more video lines, you end up with a 
wrong result because the above formula doesn't keep track of which lines 
were 512 or 508 cycles.

So, the only solution to handle this is to keep an array of the number of 
cycles since the vbl for each video line ; this way the video line is 
determined by looking for the closer entry to the current cycle_since_vbl 
value, and the position in the line is :
  pos = cycle_since_vbl - cycle_since_vbl_for_current_line

Each time an HBL int occurs, we update the cycle counter for this HBL, so 
at the end of a frame, we have the cycle position of each HBL.

I added a global ShifterFrame structure to hold all shifter's related 
variables. State of each line (including start position of each HBL) is 
stored in ShifterLines[].

Conversion between Cycles_GetCounter(CYCLES_COUNTER_VIDEO) and video line 
and pos is done with Video_ConvertPosition.

Another aspect to emulate is to have dynamic position for the HBL and 
Timer B interrupt. Whenever freq and/or resolution is changed, HBL and 
Timer B position are now re-computed (Video_HBL_GetPos and 
Video_TimerB_GetPos). Functions used to change to interrupts' positions 
have been grouped in Video_AddInterruptTimerB and Video_AddInterruptHBL.

Many border timings were also computed by using nFrameCycles, which was 
not accurate enough for top/bottom removing, as it didn't give correct 
result when 50/60 Hz lines were mixed.

Freq/res changes are now tested against a line/position couple that 
handles lines with different number of cycles.
Each time freq and/or res are changed, the current position is stored in a 
SHIFTER_POS variable that keeps the corresponding hbl/cycle for this 
position.

This way of testing positions using a X/Y representation is quite similar 
to the way the shifter works and will give better results and should be 
easier to read/maintain.

Some special cases were improved (mostly for &quot;bad&quot; code that switch to 60 
Hz for too long) in order to have a behaviour similar to the shifter.

video.c should also handle left+2 line in 50 Hz (512 cycles) ; these lines 
are very tricky to get on an STF, as most of the time you will get a 60 Hz 
line with 2 bytes more in the left border, which can distort display.
Only demo to use this is the hardscroll by Paulo Simoes in 
atari-forum.com, which requires a 2 cycles precision on STF to work.

Then, quite some code was refactored/grouped to try to use common 
functions and to avoid duplicating freq/res tests as it was the case 
before.

This new code is more accurate, but is also less error &quot;tolerant&quot; ; this 
means that any error when computing DisplayStartCycle and DisplayEndCycle 
when borders are changed could have serious impact on the emulated image 
you get. So don't be afraid if some programs show strange regressions :)


I also corrected a problem in int.c : Int_AddAbsoluteInterrupt was not 
calling Int_UpdateInterrupt which could cause the interrupt list to be 
broken if Int_AddAbsoluteInterrupt was called when PendingInterruptCount 
was already &lt; 0.
This problem was never seen before, but with the new timings in video.c 
the problem can be seen during the loader of Dark Side Of The Spoon by ULM : 
the demo will freeze and hatari will enter an endless loop, taking 100% 
CPU.


TODO :
------

- next missing major shifter behaviour is to emulate the fact that 
switching resolution can skip some displayed pixel (as used in the 
overscan's stabilizer or also in ST Connexion 4 pixels hardscroll).
The goal is to have an &quot;automatic&quot; model that compute the correct pixels 
shifting.

  - clean the code : I left a lot of commented code, ugly #ifdef and things 
like that. Don't worry, I will remove them and clean everything, but for 
now I prefer having them here as it's faster to look for regression by 
just uncommenting the previous version of the code.
