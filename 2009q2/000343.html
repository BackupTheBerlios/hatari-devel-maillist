Not necessarily, you could also &quot;parse&quot; the breakpoint structure and 
generate the corresponding breakpoint ; this would not be exactly what the 
user typed, but it should give the same result.

&gt;<i>

</I>
Well, I'm convinced of it :) At least I use it extensivily in steem. Note 
that breakpoint should not be seen as only stop on PC, but also as the 
possibilty to stop when an address contain a certain value (very useful to 
debug sync/freq changes in fullscreen).

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Only the left side should be enough. I think we need boolean AND, so
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> maybe using '&amp;' and '&amp;&amp;' is enough to separate bitwise/boolean meaning ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If bitwise '&amp;' is needed only on the left side, the boolean AND can be
</I>&gt;<i> also '&amp;' (shorter to type :-)).
</I>
Yes, but keeping the same distinction as in C with &amp; and &amp;&amp; is nice for 
the user too, even if in C the distinction could also be removed most of 
the time.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (a1).w = d1 : stop if the 16 bits pointed by a0 are the same as the 16
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> lower bits of register d0.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> So the mask should affect both sides?  Wouldn't it be more logical
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> for the comparison operation then?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>  ( a1 ) =w d1
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I would say we use the smallest mask of both side, so (a1).w=d1.b would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compare only 8 bits. I find the =w a little strange to read ; I think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> adding .b .w .l after the register is closer to what a 68000 coder would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> use when coding in asm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it can be specified only for the operator, that makes the parsing easier.
</I>&gt;<i> It also makes it more explicit for the user what's the size.  It could be
</I>&gt;<i> with &quot;.&quot; though if that makes it clearer:
</I>&gt;<i> 	( a1 ) =.w d1
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Semantically it's more of a width for the comparison than value :-))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, my idea was in fact to associate always a mask to a &lt;value&gt;.
That is a &lt;value&gt; is 32 bits (address or number), and the mask is also 32 
bits.

int Value;
int ValueType;
int ValueMask;

If no mask or size is given, then ValueMask is $ffffff.
Else ValueMask is SizeMask &amp; Mask.

That's whay I was thinking about putting the size suffix in the &lt;value&gt; 
and not in the &lt;condition&gt;, because in fact the SizeMask is a ValueMask.

So : ($ff8209).b &amp; 3 would give :

Value = $ff8209
ValueType = ADDRESS
ValueMask = $ff &amp; 3 = 3

Then when comparing Value1 and Value2, we have CommonMask = Value1Mask &amp; 
Value2Mask, and we compare ( Value1 &amp; CommonMask ) with ( Value2 &amp; 
CommonMask).

&gt;&gt;<i> Or stop at a given PC when it changed the color to $700 :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pc=$1234 &amp;&amp; ($ff8240).w=$700
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> But the logical OR chaining is less useful, as it could be done with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another different breakpoint.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem with that is the ordering.   I mean, you could do this:
</I>&gt;<i> 	(cond1 &amp;&amp; cond2) ||&#160;cond3
</I>&gt;<i> but to get this:
</I>&gt;<i> 	(cond1 ||&#160;cond2) &amp;&amp; cond3
</I>&gt;<i> you would need to write it like this to get it properly ORed with separate
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoints:
</I>&gt;<i> 	(cond1 &amp;&amp; cond3) ||&#160;(cond2 &amp;&amp; cond3)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At least for now I would like to avoid the additional code &amp; complexity of
</I>&gt;<i> multiple breakpoints as the same can be achieved by conditions chaining.
</I>&gt;<i> I would assume that normally one is debugging just one thing?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're worried about typing, readline already makes it convenient to
</I>&gt;<i> modify a breakpoint condition you gave earlier so I don't think that's an
</I>&gt;<i> issue either.  You just give all the conditions you're interested about in
</I>&gt;<i> an order that you want them to work.
</I>
As above, I really think that having different breakpoint is more useful 
than chaining them with OR. Especially when you want to remove one of the 
condition you're not interested in anymore, then you just remove the 
corresponding breakpoint number.

With the OR approach of only one breakpoint, you would need to retype the 
whole line, and even with readline, I don't think it's the more convenient 
way to reenter eveything.


&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, and I think we can have a hard limit like 50 or so for the array
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> size to avoid dynamic resizing or things like that. I think having
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dynamic memory allocation for breakpoint is a little overkill
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you really need both condition chaining and multiple breakpoints, then
</I>&gt;<i> it may be better done with dynamic allocations.  I hope condition chaining
</I>&gt;<i> would be enough though...?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Well, for now, we could have some hard limits, for example max 16 
breakpoints, and max 6 conditions chained with an AND in one breakpoint. 
Breakpoints won't consume much ram in the end, so having some fixed limits 
and some &quot;lost&quot; memory doesn't look like a problem to me.
