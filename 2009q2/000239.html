Just adding my tupence here ;).

 

&gt;<i> It's still not clear to me what this should really be good for. What's
</I>&gt;<i> the real purpose for dumping registers/memory/disassembly as soon as
</I>&gt;<i> you enter the debugger?
</I>
 

For me (often) I want to break the program because I really don't know why its taking so long to do something (e.g. &quot;Oh, oh. Thats fishy&quot;). In this situation a quick dump of the current processor state/stack/disassembly can be all the info I need to maybe say to myself &quot;Oh, that what its doing. ok, i'll give it the benitif of the doubt.&quot; and then let it run to give it more time to try and complete (i'm an impatient creature when it comes to running code ;)). So I think maybe this is prehaps part of what people are thinking? having some method where at a glance you check some basic context information to see if things seem plausable then be off again. If it was configurable from command line or whatever, you could pre-consider some specifics to monitor. 

 

&gt;<i> we should focus our energy on implementing proper breakpoint and single-stepping support, I think.
</I>

Prehaps you could propose how the debugger should be improved and maybe give a list of features you think we should be implementing to meet these comments :) then we could maybe discuss the specifics of their workings to try and meet as many of the needs talked of (or at least state why we choose to do it whichever way and how the need would be indirectly meet, basicly it could start as a formalised transcript of current discussion)? If you needed me to i'd be willing to help gather together some of the points that have been discussed into a little goals, aims, decisions and discussion type document to cover where we are up to? or that can go to whoever is assuming the role of tracking development / documentation? or you can tell me i'm silly and to get on with coding my GEMDOS configuration page ;) hehe :).

 

I do think though A document of development direction would be great, it could contain a list of development &quot;guidelines&quot; and could prehaps become a FAQ kinda document for things already covered.

 

Thanks for listening,

DoggyDude
