<PRE>Hello,
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> The .w means nothing in DSP, as you always access to DSP memory
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (internal or external) in word size (24 bits).
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why when writing to R* &amp; N* registers in the DSP_Disasm_SetRegister()
</I>&gt;<i> function you limited writes to 16-bits in dsp.c?  Because the offset cannot
</I>&gt;<i> be larger (although dsp_core struct uses Uint32 for this and other
</I>&gt;<i> registers except PC)?
</I>&gt;<i> For some registers you used even bitmasks that have holes...?
</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>No, in DSP, memory and registers are 2 completly different things.

1) Memory

Memory is 32Ko word sized. (a dsp word is always 24 bits).
Memory goes from $0 to $FFFF (Yes, I know it's 64 Ko, let me explain).

DSP contains 3 internal RAM

X internal RAM : 0 -&gt; FF
Y internal RAM : 0 -&gt; FF
P internal RAM : 0 -&gt; 1FF

DSP also contains 2 internal ROMS
X internal ROM : FF -&gt; 1FF
Y internal ROM : FF -&gt; 1FF

DSP contains 2 peripheral datas area
X peripheral : FFC0 -&gt; FFFF
Y peripheral : FFC0 -&gt; FFFF

DSP contains also a 32K external ram

P memory is mapped on the 32 K of this ram (the upper 32K addresses are 
identical to the lower 32 K) (it's a 32k shadow memory)

Y memory is a 16K area and is mapped from 0 to 3fff in P memory
X memory is a 16K area and is mapped from 4000 to 7fff in P memory.

So, if you write to address x:300, x:4300, x:8300, x:c300, p:4300, 
p:c300, you write to the exactly same addresses. The same for y memory.
But if you write to x:0 (internal DSP Ram), or x:4000 (external RAM), 
these are 2 different rams.


2) Registers

Registers are not in memory, they're not used to access to memory except 
R0-R7 registers.

A and B are 2 56 bits registers.
A is composed of A2 (8 bits), A1 (24 bits) and A0 (24 bits).
B is composed of B2 (8 bits), B1 (24 bits) and B0 (24 bits).

X and Y are two 48 bits registers.

X is composed of X1 (24 bits) and X0 (24 bits).
Y is composed of Y1 (24 bits) and Y0 (24 bits).

R0-R7 are 16 bits registers
N0-N7 are 16 bits registers
M0-M7 are 16 bits registers

LA and LC are 16 bits registers.

SR register is used to keep the state of the DSP (carry bit, overflow 
bit, ...) This register contains holes (not all the bits are used to 
keep informations, the unused bits must be 0).


A move x:(R6) reads the value of register R6 (a 16 bits value), then 
reads at address (R6) in x memory the 24 bits value.

R0-R7 are 16 bits registers because DSP memory is ranged from $0 to 
$ffff (16 bits).
The datas contained in memory are 24 bits ranged.


&gt;<i> (although dsp_core struct uses Uint32 for this and other
</I>&gt;<i> registers except PC)?
</I>

Yes, Patrice chose to code the registers in a array.
So he used a Uint32 because of the 24 bits registers. That's why we 
apply masks for the 16 bits and less registers.

Hope this helps (if not, don't hesitate to ask).

Regards,

Laurent
