<PRE>Hi,

I'm still searching the biggest bug I've had to correct (more than 1 
month of searches for now).

With the latest release of hatari, I've noticed that some demos like 
&quot;Motion screens&quot; and especially Alive demo (by FUN) behave differently 
than before.

If I take the Alive Demo, it was starting with a black screen, then I 
could see some effects.
(I could also see the water effect by starting bad Mood before alive demo).

Now, it starts with a crappy screen and freezes after music starts.

I've had a look at the DSP code.
During the loading of the &quot;Alive demo&quot;, DSP is just loading the DSP code 
of the demo at address 7ea9 and more. It does nothing else. (no sound, 
no transfers to 68030).

So, I think that the picture with &quot;Fun Industries&quot; and a rotating wheel 
should display.
(For me, it's just 68030 code, no DSP code).

(You can see the very first screen of the demo here : 
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXZVhPX5OzA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXZVhPX5OzA</A>)

Do you think it could come from a Videl problem (a resolution that we 
don't emulate correctly for example) ?



For Motion screens, many of them starts with crappy screen too. (it 
seems to be the same problem).

Regards,

Laurent
