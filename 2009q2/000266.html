Hello,

this is similar to something I proposed some times ago to measure the 
impact of some modifications regarding screen rendering (and it similar to 
some pc games that run a predefined sequence for 30 sec to see how fast 
your PC is), but it has some drawbacks under multitasking OS (linux or 
others) :

  - any running program will interfere with hatari, so you need to be sure 
you close all other apps.

  - sound can be a problem and can generate latency ; hatari should be run 
with sound off.


Nevertheless, this could give some first results on whether a modification 
has some impact ; but if the modif only change cpu ressources a few %, it 
will be hard to measure because this method has a rather big error margin.

But one could imagine an option 'run for x VBLs then exit'. This way, 
you could restore a memory snapshot of the same demo sequence for example, 
run it full speed for 30*50 VBLs then exit and measure the time it took.

Perhaps we could also disable video output in that case, to be sure that 
no sound/video layer is slowing down hatari and that we're measuring only 
hatari's routines (this means rendering the st/falcon screen in memory, 
but not sending it to the user's display).

But the most precise way would certainly be to put some &quot;probes&quot; at 
specific location when entering/exiting various functions and sum the 
total time.
