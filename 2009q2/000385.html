Btw.  Laurent, I just started to think about DSP memory addresses in
the conditional breakpoints.  I don't currently have any clue how they're
supposed to be used in the DSP code.

I mean, with DSP addresses, you need also to specify which memory space
it belongs to.  It could be specified e.g. as &quot;x$200&quot;, &quot;$x200&quot;, &quot;$200x&quot;.

But the main thing is about what to do with the indirect addressing, how
it's determined into which memory space a register points into?  Is it based
on what register is used or some other information?  Or would you (also)
need to be able to specify it in the breakpoint e.g. like in:
	(x0/p).w &amp; 3 = $200&quot;
?

If memory space needs to be explicitly specified in indirect register
addressing, then there needs to be some separator for the address space
like '/' above.  I would use it them also in addresses like in &quot;x/$200&quot;...


&gt;<i> Btw. Decimal is currently the default number format in conditional
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoints, hexadecimal values need to have the '$' prefix as you
</I>&gt;<i> requested earlier.
