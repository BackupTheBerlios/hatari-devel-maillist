<PRE>Hi,

Thomas, Laurent &amp; Nicholas, could you comment on this stuff?

(I'm leaving for vacation on Thursday and I would like to have the stuff
fixed and also commited before that if the approach is OK for you.)


On Saturday 13 June 2009, Eero Tamminen wrote:
&gt;&gt;<i> Things still to do:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. debug &amp; fix bugs so that it passes the (fairly extensive) parsing
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tests
</I>
Parser works fine after some extra fixes I'll commit later today.

Matching the breakpoints is still to be tested, but the code for that is
much simpler and hopefully Nicolas can help in that after breakcond.c
is integrated with the rest of the Hatari...


&gt;&gt;<i> 2. add register name parsing code 
</I>
See attached register-cpu.diff and register-dsp.diff patch files on proposal
how I thought this could be done.

In both cases I've separated the code from register setting functions
(in debugui.c and dsp.c respectively) to a globally visible function that
returns address for given register.  This function is then used by DebugUI
register setting functions and will be used by breakcond (I'll commit the
support for this after some extra breakcond.c testing).

This doesn't yet provide all registers for breakcond.c (see [1]), but
the change is completely transparent to current debugger register setting
functionality.

The CPU register code could be minimized by using index instead of switch
case for data &amp; address registers like (original) DSP code did.  m68000.h
could provide a macro or inline for this.  I use array &amp; bisecting for
finding the DSP register as there are so many of them.

Laurent &amp; Thomas, any comments on these?  Does the approach seem OK?


&gt;<i> &gt; 3. integrate it with DebugUI etc.
</I>
breakcond-integrate.diff shows how I've thought to integrate breakcond.c
into debugui.c:

* similarly to address breakpoints and single stepping, there are two
  additional variables for condition breakpoint DSP &amp; CPU counts which
   values are checked and requested from breakcond.c at appropriate place.

* DebugUI_BreakCondCpu()/Dsp() are debugui.c wrappers for breakcond.c
  BreakCond_Command() function (not yet commited to breakcond.c).
  Commands list has entries for these.

* Because I don't want to join again the arguments from debugui.c for the
  breakpoint condition code's own tokenizing, I added support to debugui.c
  for specifying that the arguments for certain options shouldn't be
  separated. There's a new bNoParsing flag to command structure to signify
  this and the DebugUI command parsing function code was suffled around
  a bit to support this.

* Address breakpoint names are now &quot;address&quot;/&quot;a&quot; and condition breakpoints
  are &quot;breakpoint&quot;/&quot;b&quot;.  Address breakpoints are still needed[1].

I'll commit the functions needed in breakcond.c for above after some extra
testing.

Thomas, any comments on this?


&gt;&gt;<i> I was thinking that for 2), I would generalize both the current DSP and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CPU code for checking the register values for DebugUI so that there
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> would be for both of them functions that take register name and return
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it's address and size, or an error if there was no match.
</I>
[1] Register address functions (and therefore condition breakpoints) don't
currently support all registers because I couldn't yet come up with a nice
way how to get register information nicely to the register setting DebugUI
functions for things that need extra processing when they're set
(PC &amp; SR for m68k; SR, SP, OMR, SSH, SSL for DSP).

Maybe the register name -&gt; address functions could return also register
ID and based on this the the register set functions would do these extra
things?

Handling of the register width is also something that needs extra thought as
some DSP registers width differs from mask that needs to be used with them.
For example:
-------------
        if (arg[0]=='S' || arg[0]=='s') {
                if (arg[1]=='R' || arg[1]=='r') {
                        dsp_core.registers[DSP_REG_SR] = value &amp; 0xefff;
                        return;
                }
                if (arg[1]=='P' || arg[1]=='p') {
                        dsp_core.registers[DSP_REG_SP] = value &amp; BITMASK(6);
-------------

0xefff = 1110111111111111 i.e. there's a hole in the middle.

Laurent, is this mask needed also in the debugger when reading
a register value (I guess it's 16-bit register as mask is 16-bit)?

(IMHO improvements in these can be done later.)


&gt;<i> Also, any objections if I:
</I>&gt;<i> - add tests/-directory to Hatari top level
</I>&gt;<i> - put the breakpoint condition testing code there + Makefile that
</I>&gt;<i>   automatically validates that breakpoint condition parsing works fine?
</I>
?

&gt;<i> I could extend the test code later also to test automatically that
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoints get also triggered (not just parsed) fine.  This only needs
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;emulating&quot; Hatari registers and their changes from the test code.
</I>
I also noticed that many headers (e.g. DSP ones) missed &quot;extern&quot;s
for functions.  Any objections on adding those?
