I'm mostly concerned about the DSP side.  Currently e.g. even the trivial
DSP_Run() is quite visible in profile because it's run 7x for each m68k
instruction and this adds a lot of code to execute at that place when
there're conditional breakpoints.  (And half of the time DSP emu would like
to take much more CPU than my machine has available.... :-))

Extra performance may also be nice for speeding up the emulation
while waiting the breakpoint to trigger.  But let's see whether this will be
a problem in practice.

PS. I added the current code as breakcond.c to repo.  I will shortly add
some more parsing code to it + do some other fine-tuning.
