<PRE>Hi,

Thanks!  They're now commited so that others can test the breakpoint stuff
more easily.

Nicolas, could you test the conditional breakpoint stuff a bit and tell what
all I need to fix? :-)


Do you have any ideas how I could or should improve things e.g. in regards 
to variable naming, things I mentioned earlier mail, whether the CPU
register address thing should be in debugui.c (and not e.g. somewhere under
uae-cpu) etc?


Next I'm going to look into DSP memory access support.

Btw. The BITMASK macro is in three separate dsp*.c files and now also in
breakcond.c.  Which header it should be put into and should it have some
prefix?


&gt;<i> &gt; There might be also other complicated things in Hatari which could
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; profit from regression tests, although writing automation code for them
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (e.g. DSP)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; could be quite complicated...  Do you think Hatari could in future have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; automated test code for other stuff?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (Just breakcond.c test code alone in tests/-dir could be silly.  :-))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I currently don't think there is any other part of the code that would
</I>&gt;<i> need automated test code... so I'd say to either keep the #ifdef'd main
</I>&gt;<i> function in breakcond.c or keep it save on your hard disk.
</I>
Ok, I'll keep it in breakcond.c.

What about adding &quot;test&quot; &quot;test-with-valgrind&quot; targets to src/Makefile
that would build (things like) breakcond.c using &quot;-DTEST=1&quot; and run it?
