<PRE>Hi,

On Friday 24 April 2009, <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/hatari-devel">npomarede at corp.free.fr</A> wrote:

Definitely.

</I>
Laurent &amp; Thomas got just DSP sound output working and that's also
something that needs to be optimized later on, but in normal case it
indeed makes sense to disable sound.


&gt;<i> Nevertheless, this could give some first results on whether a
</I>&gt;<i> modification has some impact ; but if the modif only change cpu
</I>&gt;<i> ressources a few %, it will be hard to measure because this method has a
</I>&gt;<i> rather big error margin.
</I>
This isn't certainly mean to be the only method.

If it's a question of small piece of code, one could do a separate tester
program that tests the performance of the new and old algorithm (e.g. runs
it in loop and is called with &quot;time &lt;test&gt;&quot; enough times to get a stable
number, that's what I did when I optimized some float operations to use
integer).

Depending on how localized an optimization is, even
(e.g. valgrind/kcachegrind) profiler output could be used for verifying
the optimization.

For a large optimization one could use just &quot;top&quot;.


&gt;<i> But one could imagine an option 'run for x VBLs then exit'. This way,
</I>&gt;<i> you could restore a memory snapshot of the same demo sequence for
</I>&gt;<i> example, run it full speed for 30*50 VBLs then exit and measure the time
</I>&gt;<i> it took.
</I>
Good idea, I added that to the patch (attached).


&gt;<i> Perhaps we could also disable video output in that case, to be sure that
</I>&gt;<i> no sound/video layer is slowing down hatari and that we're measuring only
</I>&gt;<i> hatari's routines (this means rendering the st/falcon screen in memory,
</I>&gt;<i> but not sending it to the user's display).
</I>
Doing skipping always with the exit-after-N-VBLs isn't a good idea in case
somebody wants to measure video output performance.

But the attached updated patch removes the maximum limit (currently 8) for
the --frameskips option.

Just run Hatari with something like:
	VBLs=$((30*50))
	./hatari --fast-forward yes --run-vbls $VBLs --frameskips $VBLs


&gt;<i> But the most precise way would certainly be to put some &quot;probes&quot; at
</I>&gt;<i> specific location when entering/exiting various functions and sum the
</I>&gt;<i> total time.
</I>
In that case it would be better just e.g. output it so that one can
post-process it and calculate average/median/deviation to see how
reliable the measurement is statistically.
