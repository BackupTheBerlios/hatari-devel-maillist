Well, I think that even if debug and pause use the same key, it's normal 
that when in debug mode pressing 'pause' again doesn't exit debug mode and 
simulate a 'c'.
Either we have a complete second window that would popup (similar to monst 
debugger for example) with some icons too that the user could use, or we 
just drop the user into the debug shell and he knows how to use it 
anyway.

What about a flag to tell what to do when we're in debug mode and the 
pause key is pressed ? For example --debug-start = none or dump_reg or 
dump_code or dump_all or ... ?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Or maybe there should be a separate debug mode that would just dump the info
</I>&gt;<i> and then continue emulation?  (then -D could take an argument for what it
</I>&gt;<i> dumps whenever debugger key is pressed)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
considering the speed at which the 68000 is changing its state, I don't 
see many interest in dumping the content of the register and continuing 
the emulation. I don't think anyone will succeed in dumping what he 
expects at the exact time.
