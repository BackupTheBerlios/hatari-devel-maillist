</I>
Control socket is still nice as an option.

With Python there seems to be some latency issues, but I think they should
go away if the debugger would be coded in C/C++.  Default Linux socket
buffer size could affect that also[1], AFAIK it's geared towards throughput,
not latency.

[1]&#160;On my Debian Lenny this seems to be 109KB:
     cat /proc/sys/net/core/*mem_default
Setting them e.g. to 2048 bytes (kernel doubles it to one memory page) with
setsockopt() SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF options could help and even Python
socket module seems to support them.    I could play with them a bit when
I start again updating the Hatari Python UI.


&gt;<i> Maybe we should start to use gtk windows within the hatari executable
</I>&gt;<i> itself? 
</I>
I would rather leave toolkits out of Hatari, there are too many of them out
there. :-)


&gt;<i> Or maybe rather extend  the gui-sdl code (or statusbar?) with some
</I>&gt;<i> debugging dialogs? 
</I>
It could work like native Atari debuggers.  Debugger uses the same screen as
emulated Atari and you have some shortcut (Pause?) to flip between the
debugger screen and Atari screen.

In Falcon emulation some demos (like TYS) can set really small screen sizes,
I'm not sure what to do then though.  Switching screen size would be pretty
ugly.


&gt;<i> Well, one thing is clear: It's a lot of work.
</I>
The effort to get just what the current debugger does, but in SDL window
might be reasonable as Hatari already has text output and input stuff done
with SDL.  Just that wouldn't be so useful though.

</I>
Sure, It would be much more useful once these have been implemented.
I.e. showing the status of registers etc when a breakpoint happens, or
automatically showing more of disassembly when single-stepping.

With SDL debugger screen this information could be positioned always
to same place.  In console debugger this could be done with ncurses,
but that would again be one more dependency for Hatari which is harder
to get on non-Linux platforms (and I doubt we would support a debugger
both with and without ncurses)...
