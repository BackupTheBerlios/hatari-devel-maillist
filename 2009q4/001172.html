The problem in Falcon mode are most likely not the ST borders, but the
fact that it switches the resolution a couple of times until the
Desktop is reached.

It normally works like this (in ST mode): During Reset_Cold() we set
the host mouse pointer to the middle of the screen, and when the ST has
finally booted, the ST mouse pointer is roughly in sync with the host
mouse pointer since it also appears in the middle of the screen.

Now in Falcon mode, we also set the host mouse pointer to the middle of
the screen, but the Falcon TOS then switches the resolution a couple of
times until the desktop has been reached, so the Falcon mouse pointer
is not in sync with the host mouse pointer anymore.

You could try the following:

1) For debugging, change the &quot;SDL_ShowCursor(SDL_DISABLE)&quot; to
&quot;SDL_ShowCursor(SDL_ENABLE)&quot; in screen.c, then you can see the host
mouse pointer, too.

2) Try to add something like &quot;Main_WarpMouse(sdlscrn-&gt;w/2,
 sdlscrn-&gt;h/2)&quot; at the end of HostScreen_setWindowSize() in
falcon/hostscreen.c to see whether this helps a little bit.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
That keyboard shortcut should lock the mouse pointer within the Hatari
window. Have a look at your hatari.cfg to see whether it has been
configured to a different key.
