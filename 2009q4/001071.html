Hi!

Thanks a lot for adding this. A friend compiled it for me (I never seem 
to get it to compile) and it seems to behave exactly like before, eg a 
screen with wrong linewidth (I tested MOLZ so far). Is there any 
commandline switch I need to add for the new code to work ?

Hum, this seems to be perhaps a wrong approach, on the STe the screen is 
shifted a bit to the right with this method, as far as I can tell we are 
not losing any pixels. Eg, the pixels far to the right which are normally 
garbage with a traditional 230 byte overscan are now displaying perfectly 
looking graphics.

To put it short, the pixels lost at the left are gained at the right. So 
as I see it, Hatari should just show the usual 416px screen and adjust the 
raster position by N cycles.

Oh and by the way, the leftmost part of the screen (before the graphics 
begin) shows the background colour on a real STe, not that it should 
matter for Hatari as this part shouldn't be displayed in normal cases.



And now to something completely different.. It's soon christmas, so here 
goes some wishes that would ease coding fullscreens quite a bit :)

* A mode where Hatari shows all 512x313 pixels, with the &quot;non visible&quot; 
areas  toned out to say half brightness. This way one can easily follow 
every clock cycle graphicly. A popular way to determine rastertime is to change 
the background colour, today one can't see that if it's outside the 
visible area, as an example.

* Fullscreen mode not to crop any pixels - on OS X today Hatari in a 
window crawls. Doing fastforward increases perhaps the speed by 20%, while 
in fullscreen it screams. However in fullscreen it's missing a lot of 
pixels.


Ok I'll stop now, thanks again for working on this overscan mode :-)
