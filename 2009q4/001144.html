<PRE>Hello.

First, let's be clear.

I use very few Hatari. Not because it is bad software, but because I'm
usually very happy with Steem and ARAnyM on Windows. Personally, I don't
need additional debugging features, but of course it would be very nice.

In the past, I used the Mappy VM GameBoy Advance emulator.
<A HREF="http://www.bottledlight.com/mappy/">http://www.bottledlight.com/mappy/</A>
I often think to it, because it is an absolutely great piece of
software. More than an emulator, it is an incredible real time debugger.
It has special windows to see the status of the hardware. For example,
the contents of the video memory can be displayed in real time, with the
ability to change the display settings according to the different modes,
and so on.

I often dream about such abilities in an Atari emulator. Something like
a real time Ultimate Ripper.

Such things would be good, but it is not a necessity for me right now.
I want to focus on the ACP project.

Now here are my answers.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What specifically is the problem in debugging these?
</I>
For fVDI and MyAES, I don't know, I have never tried.
It would probably possible to debug them with a standard Falcon
debugger. GDB can only debug MiNT process, it may be able to debug
MyAES, for fVDI I don't know. Someone should try that.

&gt;<i> Or is the issue
</I>&gt;<i> finding out what these do also within MiNT (e.g. in XaAES kernel extension)?
</I>
It is probably an issue with XaAES which is a kernel module.

&gt;<i> Cannot Gdb  (run
</I>&gt;<i> remotely e.g. over SSH) attach to multiple processes?
</I>
GDB can be used remotely via direct TCP connection.
There is GDB 5.1 on my website, and some concrete explanations:
<A HREF="http://vincent.riviere.free.fr/soft/m68k-atari-mint/">http://vincent.riviere.free.fr/soft/m68k-atari-mint/</A>
I have used the gdbserver tool inside MiNT running on ARAnyM, then I
have used the gdb tool on Cygwin to attach to the MiNT process. It works
fine.

Note that the source of the gdbserver tool is really simple, we could
even imagine Hatari acting lile a big gdbserver, then any gdb variant
could be connected to it, providing its standard debug facilities.

Some time ago, I have started porting GDB 7.0 to MiNT. It is quite
different from the old versions, so some code has to be rewritten. I
have not fully finished, but it works enough to debug a process with the
basic facilities.

There are special stuff in the new GDB for debugging multiple processes.

&gt;<i> I assume debugging these doesn't need MMU (Hatari can run MiNT,
</I>&gt;<i> but not with MP enabled as Hatari doesn't emulate MMU currently).
</I>
The current implementation of GDB communicates with the debugged process
with the Ptrace() function call. It doesn't require an MMU. However, it
should work fine with full memory protection enabled too, I have not tested.

&gt;&gt;<i> If the debug info is in DRI format all the labels are in the executable, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> its easy.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have a pointer to DRI (on-disk) format documentation?
</I>
The only documentation I have is the C code generating such debug
information in the binutils patch available on my website:
<A HREF="http://vincent.riviere.free.fr/soft/m68k-atari-mint/">http://vincent.riviere.free.fr/soft/m68k-atari-mint/</A>
This patch has been originally written by Guido Flohr.
I think I have understood most of it, it is really simple. For each
symbol, there is a 14-byte entry (?) in the symbol table. This entry
contains a symbol name, the address associated with the symbol, and some
flags. Devpac has added support for an additional 14-byte entry to allow
longer symbol names. That's all.

&gt;&gt;<i> If the debug info is in STABS format (the one produced by GCC), the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> symbols are in the executable, too,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Do you have any better documentation on the STABS on-disk data format
</I>&gt;<i> than e.g. this:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://sourceware.org/gdb/download/onlinedocs/stabs.html#Symbol-Tables">http://sourceware.org/gdb/download/onlinedocs/stabs.html#Symbol-Tables</A>
</I>&gt;<i> ?
</I>
I have never parsed such debug info myself, it's the job of the BFD
library. The symbols are in STABS format, the standard debug format for
a.out executables. I know there is a string table allowing strings of
any length. Then there is a symbol table of fixed-length structures,
referencing a string as symbol name, an address and some flags. Again,
nothing complicated. For source-level debugging, some GNU extensions are
used as special STABS entries, I don't know them.

&gt;<i> I don't know anything (on any platform, not just Atari) that would allow
</I>&gt;<i> debugging all programs in a system, including kernel, at source level.
</I>
Why not ? If the emulator can keep the track of all the kernels and
executables loaded, it could provide source-level debugging for all of
them. It is probably not easy, but doable.

&gt;<i> The maximum level of support I was thinking of was being able to set
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoints to function and variable addresses and seeing these names when
</I>&gt;<i> doing disassembly or dumping memory contents.  Would that kind of a goal
</I>&gt;<i> be useful enough to be worth consider implementing during next year?
</I>
Back to the reality: simply setting breakpoints on assembly labels would
be great. And an extremely useful feature is &quot;data breakpoints&quot;. They
are supported on x86, but not on 68000. They can break when the data is
modified at a specific address. No native 68000 debugger will be ever
able to do that. But as Hatari is an emulator, it can do that. That
would be a killer feature. To answer the question: which buggy program
has overwritten my variables ?

Another invaluable feature would be a full history of all the assembly
instructions executed. To answer the question: how have the program
counter reached this address. Maybe Hatari has already that feature.

About MiNT, some facilities could be added into the kernel to ease
debugging from an external debugger.

Well, it would be possible to do a lot of cool things.
