<PRE>Hi,

But If one wants to use one's own naming convention within a file, at least
the global variables should follow naming consistent with other global
variables.  Otherwise the inconsistency spreads to multiple files.

(Within one's own file, one can then think the prefix as something that
differentiates the global variables from static or local ones.)


&gt;<i> Yes, and I've seen some projects already where people start mixing

</I>
Btw. I guess you've seen also things like:
	if (0 == a)
?

That's very defensive programming. It avoids the mistake of accidentally
having an assignment (=) instead of (==) comparison (assignment lvalue
cannot be a constant, so build would fail).  However, it's not anymore
needed with GCC because GCC warns about assignments (used in conditions)
that aren't parenthesised.
