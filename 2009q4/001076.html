Yes, I'm planning to resolve these 2 points :
  - remove the left part with 16 pixels using 2 bitplanes
  - center the screen to the left ; correct value seems to be ~8 pixels
    earlier (when compared with a normal 160 bytes line).

For the second point, I need to update the test program I sent you last 
time to &quot;calibrate&quot; the exact shifting.

In fact, what you propose (if I understand it correctly) would work
if the screen contains only 224 bytes lines for example. But on STF 
there're some screens mixing 230 and 160 bytes lines and in that case 
centering each line on the screen is not good because graphics would not 
be aligned (see the picture at the start of ULM's hidden screen in Oh 
Crickey ... for an example).

With 230 bytes overscan, you need in fact to shift the whole line 4 pixels 
to the left to stay aligned with a 160 bytes lines and to work similarly 
as a real ST (you would have a similar problem if you centered the line 
when adding 16 pixels to left border on STE (by changing hscroll), gfx 
would not be correctly aligned with a normal ST line).

What I want to obtain is the same effect as you can see on the picture you 
posted earlier : we can see that the 224 bytes screen is not &quot;centered&quot; 
the same way as a 230 bytes one. So I must remove the 2 bitplanes on the 
left, but I don't want the &quot;visible&quot; pixels to start at the same place.
