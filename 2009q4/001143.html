<PRE><A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/hatari-devel">npomarede at corp.free.fr</A> a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> this may be feasible, but is it really useful ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apart from the complexity to load/parse the different debug symbols 
</I>&gt;<i> formats (for example, if I recall correctly devpac could produce 3 
</I>&gt;<i> different format), what will it be used for ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In any case, it won't be possible to use this with existing 
</I>&gt;<i> games/demos, so only case would be for programs compiled with debug 
</I>&gt;<i> symbols (I don't think there're a lot of them) or for homemade asm 
</I>&gt;<i> programs that users would compile from their own sources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But in that case, I think that adebog or monst are way more powerful 
</I>&gt;<i> than Hatari debugger, with a built in window system, register locking, 
</I>&gt;<i> search in disasm mode, ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really used a lot of this some years ago and I don't see how adding 
</I>&gt;<i> symbol to hatari debugger would make it much useful than debugging 
</I>&gt;<i> directly under the emulated atari, there so much power in monst that 
</I>&gt;<i> making Hatari at the same level would be a huge task.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, that's just my point, but I don't think this is worth the effort 
</I>&gt;<i> and the added complexity/bloat that may result in the code (at least 
</I>&gt;<i> it would be limited to debugui.c, so not much side effect on other parts)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nicolas
</I>Well, a native emulator debugger has many advantages compared to 
something like MonST/Adebog.

In Euphoric (Oric emulator), we have the possibility to load a file 
containing just a simple list of adresses/labels, and this by itself is 
a great help.

Problem of MonST/Adebog/TurboAss, etc... is that they interact with what 
you are currently debugging. Typically an Atari ST demo uses a gazillion 
of timers, replaces the VBl, cut the mfp, etc... and is totally 
impossible to debug with MonST (monst dies as soon as the VBL is 
disabled). You can do it with Adebog in IPL/7, but then you have 
restrictions about what you can do.

I don't think such an emulator-integrated debugger should be able to 
understand all the file formats of the universe, but just being able to 
load symbols/address files would make it possible to break at any time, 
and have symbols in the rom, in the program, etc... if you add the 
possibility to add symbols from the debugger and then save them, you can 
progressively start to comment the program you are debugging.

A real native debugger can also support non intrusive breakpoints, 
breakpoints on data changes, conditional breakpoints that do not hog the 
machine, etc....
