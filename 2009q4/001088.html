Hi!

I see, I never took into account that there should be centering around a 
160 byte scanline (or even 168 byte on STe), it complicate things for 
sure. Epecially as the cycle counting needs to be centered as well so 
colour changes occour at the correct time. Phew, I'm glad I don't have to 
do those calculations :)

For some help I have compared the original last fullscreen picture from 
MOLZ to a STe-capture of the same.

It looks like there are indeed about six pixels cut off at the right part 
of the image. The left part seems intact.

Here is the comparison: <A HREF="http://ae.dhs.nu/pics/missing_pixels.png">http://ae.dhs.nu/pics/missing_pixels.png</A>

Also taking into account that the capture-picture is &lt;416 pixels and 
scaled to that level anyway, those six pixels missing might grow to about 
8. This sux :)  408 pixels and not 416 displayed as I had always thought. 
It could perhaps be sensible to limit Hataris window to 408 pixels if that 
really is all a real machine can see.
