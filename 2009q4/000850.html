</I>&gt;<i> in that case, which defaults to 50 Hz.
</I>
Ok, the manual page might mention that this is really useful only for
bootup.


&gt;<i> &gt; Btw. Should the AVI codec, cropping and file name be saved to the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; configuration file too?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't have time to do it, but it wouldn't hurt to add it to
</I>&gt;<i> configuration.c to save the defaults prefs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Other things that could be useful (mentioned earlier I think) would be to
</I>&gt;<i> have a file dialog to choose the name/directory of the avi file or the
</I>&gt;<i> png/bmp file.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And also a way to choose video codec in the gui (bmp or png, with
</I>&gt;<i> optional compression level for png) would be great.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, if you or someone else feel like adding this .. :)
</I>
You could add specific items about this to todo.txt. :-)


&gt;<i> &gt; Would it make sense to print a warning when this happens?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If (nScreenRefreshRate != avi-&gt;Fps &amp;&amp; nScreenRefreshRate !=
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; avi-&gt;warnedRefreshRate) {
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	Log_Printf(LOG_WARN, &quot;Screen Refresh Rate (%d) and AVI FPS (%d) don't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; match!\n&quot;, nScreenRefreshRate, avi-&gt;Fps);
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	avi-&gt;warnedRefreshRate = nScreenRefreshRate;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; }
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, why not ; or perhaps a message in the status bar that would be less
</I>&gt;<i> intrusive than having to click on a dialog box ?
</I>
As it should be uncommon, I think it's enough to have only console printf.


&gt;<i> &gt; Can't some demos also change the refresh rate (say Falcon ones)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure such demos are common, but some old ST demos did this and
</I>&gt;<i> sometimes included some 60 HZ screens (but I never saw demos mixing
</I>&gt;<i> frequency on the same part)
</I>
Latter sounds good for [1].


&gt;<i> &gt; In this case the warning about refresh rate change would be good so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that one can better decide which refresh rate would be best to be used
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (after seeing what is used most and when the changes happen).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The result would not be good anyway, such demos should be recorded in as
</I>&gt;<i> many parts as we have different frequencies, then grouped/reencoded to a
</I>&gt;<i> common fps using mencoder for example (Hatari alone would do a really
</I>&gt;<i> poor job)
</I>
I think trying to manually start and stop Hatari at exactly the correct 
places would be close to impossible.

[1] Maybe in this case it would be then better to automatically stop
recording and start a new one with a different name?  A bit like screenshots 
do (maybe the code for that could be generalized for both?).
