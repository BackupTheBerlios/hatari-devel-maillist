<PRE>Hi,

On Sunday 18 October 2009, <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/hatari-devel">npomarede at corp.free.fr</A> wrote:

Ok.   You surely know this stuff better than me. :-)


&gt;<i> Really, I think it's quite easy to record a few extra seconds before the
</I>&gt;<i> real part and then use a video editing tool to finely remove the unwanted
</I>&gt;<i> extra frames (mencoder can do that too, you can tell it to skip a number
</I>&gt;<i> of frames).

</I>&gt;<i> I would really like to see a practical case that is hard to record, but
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure there're that many demos doing this and that it would be a
</I>&gt;<i> real problem to record anyway.
</I>
What about the bootup case?

Is it possible to delay Avi recording starting until bootup has progressed
enough that the refresh rate is stable (i.e. to detect that somehow)?
