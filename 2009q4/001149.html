<PRE>Hi,

On Monday 28 December 2009, Vincent Rivi&#232;re wrote:

</I>
Ok, I think that should be doable.

Based on Mickael's suggestion, I think it should be enough to have:
1. cross or native &quot;nm&quot; that produces list of symbols and their addresses
    within the binary.
2. emulator facility which allows giving suitable RAM offset and loading
   the &quot;nm&quot; output so that it's relative to that offset (separately for
   text, data and bss?)
3. emulator debugger facility which can dig out process addresses (text,
   data, bss), maybe also relocation information.
4. debugger supporting using these symbols on breakpoints
5. debugger supporting showing these symbols on other output

4 &amp; 5 seem fairly straighforward, and 3) should be easy for TOS.

First debugging target for this kind of support in debugger might be
e.g. EmuTOS.

Thomas, would it be possible to get symbol &amp; absolute address mappings
for EmuTOS when EmuTOS is built?
 

&gt;<i> And an extremely useful feature is &quot;data breakpoints&quot;. They 
</I>&gt;<i> are supported on x86, but not on 68000. They can break when the data is
</I>&gt;<i> modified at a specific address. No native 68000 debugger will be ever
</I>&gt;<i> able to do that. But as Hatari is an emulator, it can do that.
</I>
It already supports that.  To check when a given memory value change,
use something like this as a breakpoint:
	b ($ff820).w ! VALUE

b -&gt; shortcut for &quot;breakpoint&quot;
() -&gt; check the value from address given in parenthesis
.w -&gt; word sized
&quot;!&quot; -&gt; not equal to
VALUE -&gt; the current value which change you want to catch


&gt;<i> That would be a killer feature. To answer the question: which buggy
</I>&gt;<i> program has overwritten my variables ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another invaluable feature would be a full history of all the assembly
</I>&gt;<i> instructions executed. To answer the question: how have the program
</I>&gt;<i> counter reached this address. Maybe Hatari has already that feature.
</I>
There's no history and a &quot;full&quot; one would take huge amounts of space.  But
you can already trace the executed instructions with &quot;trace cpu_disasm&quot;
debugger command (output goes currently only to screen unfortunately).


&gt;<i> About MiNT, some facilities could be added into the kernel to ease
</I>&gt;<i> debugging from an external debugger.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Well, it would be possible to do a lot of cool things.
</I>
I think the main thing would be to get the addresses where programs
are mapped and maybe information about context switches (what is
the currently running process).


&gt;<i> Some time ago, I have started porting GDB 7.0 to MiNT. It is quite
</I>&gt;<i> different from the old versions, so some code has to be rewritten. I
</I>&gt;<i> have not fully finished, but it works enough to debug a process with the
</I>&gt;<i> basic facilities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are special stuff in the new GDB for debugging multiple processes.
</I>
It also supports reversible debugging on some platforms:
	<A HREF="http://sourceware.org/gdb/news/reversible.html">http://sourceware.org/gdb/news/reversible.html</A>


&gt;<i> &gt; I assume debugging these doesn't need MMU (Hatari can run MiNT,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but not with MP enabled as Hatari doesn't emulate MMU currently).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current implementation of GDB communicates with the debugged process
</I>&gt;<i> with the Ptrace() function call. It doesn't require an MMU. However, it
</I>&gt;<i> should work fine with full memory protection enabled too, I have not
</I>&gt;<i> tested.
</I>
What I meant is that Hatari doesn't support MMU, so it cannot be used for
running (and debugging) anything that requires MMU, like MiNT with MP
enabled.  For those Aranym is more appropriate.


&gt;<i> &gt; Do you have a pointer to DRI (on-disk) format documentation?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The only documentation I have is the C code generating such debug
</I>&gt;<i> information in the binutils patch available on my website:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://vincent.riviere.free.fr/soft/m68k-atari-mint/">http://vincent.riviere.free.fr/soft/m68k-atari-mint/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> This patch has been originally written by Guido Flohr.
</I>
Thanks!   prg-mint.c from the patch indeed seems like a good starting point,
if nm output turns out not to  be the way to go.


&gt;<i> &gt; Do you have any better documentation on the STABS on-disk data format
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; than e.g. this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; <A HREF="http://sourceware.org/gdb/download/onlinedocs/stabs.html#Symbol-Tables">http://sourceware.org/gdb/download/onlinedocs/stabs.html#Symbol-Tables</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have never parsed such debug info myself, it's the job of the BFD
</I>&gt;<i> library. The symbols are in STABS format, the standard debug format for
</I>&gt;<i> a.out executables.
</I>
Hm.  I don't have currently any working Atari gcc/MiNT setup, so I cannot
test this right now.

But if &quot;nm&quot; can give a list of the symbols and their addresses, it's output
could actually be input file for the Hatari debugger.  Does NM support
listing symbols &amp; their address for non-stripped binaries that have their
debug symbols in DRI or STABS format (both of them)?


&gt;<i> &gt; I don't know anything (on any platform, not just Atari) that would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; allow debugging all programs in a system, including kernel, at source
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; level.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why not ? If the emulator can keep the track of all the kernels and
</I>&gt;<i> executables loaded, it could provide source-level debugging for all of
</I>&gt;<i> them. It is probably not easy, but doable.
</I>
Now that you reminded me, I actually do know one platform where I've
seen something like this. :-).

ARM has an ETM HW interface which can produce about gigabits of data per sec
about all the instructions executed (branches).  With the additional
information which tells about process context switches and where things are
mapped in RAM when this data is collected, and access to the binaries and 
their debug data, all this can indeed be post-processes to whole system
source level code flow information.  It's too slow to be done at run-time
though.
