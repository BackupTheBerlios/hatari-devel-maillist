<PRE>Hi,

On Sunday 27 December 2009, Vincent Rivi&#232;re wrote:
&gt;<i> In modern MiNT setups, we can use GDB to debug normal programs, but

</I>
What specifically is the problem in debugging these?  Cannot Gdb  (run 
remotely e.g. over SSH) attach to multiple processes?  Or is the issue
finding out what these do also within MiNT (e.g. in XaAES kernel extension)?

I assume debugging these doesn't need MMU (Hatari can run MiNT,
but not with MP enabled as Hatari doesn't emulate MMU currently).


&gt;<i> If the debug info is in DRI format all the labels are in the executable,

</I>
Do you have a pointer to DRI (on-disk) format documentation?


&gt;<i> If the debug info is in STABS format (the one produced by GCC), the
</I>&gt;<i> symbols are in the executable, too,
</I>
Do you have any better documentation on the STABS on-disk data format
than e.g. this:
<A HREF="http://sourceware.org/gdb/download/onlinedocs/stabs.html#Symbol-Tables">http://sourceware.org/gdb/download/onlinedocs/stabs.html#Symbol-Tables</A>
?


&gt;<i> but the source-level information 
</I>&gt;<i> require the sources, gdb is usually the only program able to exploit
</I>&gt;<i> this. And Hatari should have some way to find the the sources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the case of some additional debugging abilities would be added to
</I>&gt;<i> Hatari, I think the display of the symbols only (no sources) would be
</I>&gt;<i> enough at first.
</I>
I don't know anything (on any platform, not just Atari) that would allow
debugging all programs in a system, including kernel, at source level.  Gdb 
allows attaching to multiple processes at the same time (I think), but you
cannot debug both kernel, and processes kernel runs, at the same time.

The maximum level of support I was thinking of was being able to set
breakpoints to function and variable addresses and seeing these names when
doing disassembly or dumping memory contents.  Would that kind of a goal
be useful enough to be worth consider implementing during next year?


In the MiNT case I'm not sure how user could even specify properly the
process for which the debug symbols should be loaded for to the debugger.
How do you find out the process information with MiNT when only thing you
have is the HW memory contents?  (emulator doesn't have MiNT provided
information inside the emulation which Gdb can access)

Debugger could have some helpers which show information about the currently
loaded MiNT processes inside the emulation, including their memory
addresses, if there *is* a stable way to find that information from the
emulated memory somewhere.  This would be useful for reading the
dissassemby / trace output even before user could tell debugger from
which file to load debug symbols for given process/address.
