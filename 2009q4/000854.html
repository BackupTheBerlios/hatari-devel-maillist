This is not so difficult, a demo will usually really starts after a double 
click to start a .prg or after a loader asking to press &quot;space&quot;, so 
starting the recording at that time is easy and the should be ok.

&gt;<i> [1] Maybe in this case it would be then better to automatically stop

</I>&gt;<i> do (maybe the code for that could be generalized for both?).
</I>
It's hard to base a change of recording file on the freq value, because :
  - some programs are sometimes switching freq for no real reason, due to 
bad programming, but in a unnoticeable way on a real ST (it happens too 
fast, during only a few VBL)
  - programs using freq switches to remove borders are sometimes leaving 
the freq in a &quot;bad&quot; state for a few scanlines. This is not noticeable too, but 
if we try to analyze the freq at that time to change avi file, we will be 
wrong.

Really, I think it's quite easy to record a few extra seconds before the 
real part and then use a video editing tool to finely remove the unwanted 
extra frames (mencoder can do that too, you can tell it to skip a number 
of frames).

I would really like to see a practical case that is hard to record, but 
I'm not sure there're that many demos doing this and that it would be a 
real problem to record anyway.
