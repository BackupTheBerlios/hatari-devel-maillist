<PRE>Hi,

</I>
I haven't added this information because doing &quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; with text
doesn't look so good and one can already see fast forward state from
the frameskip value if one is using auto-frameskip.

I would rather have them done with suitable icons/images.
At the same time LED drawing could be replaced with nicer LED images.

These would need images for different toolbar sizes and led states.  These
kind of images should be done only with couple of colors so that they aren't
completely awful even in 8-bit mode.


But if icons aren't feasible / Thomas doesn't like having them in Hatari,
then at least I would skip &quot;&gt;&quot; and show only &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot; (when fast forward
is enabled).


&gt;<i> cpu type, cpu clock.
</I>
Where/when this information is needed?

The currently shown information is relevant for bug reports, but the shown 
machine type (ST/STE/TT/Falcon) already tells what you're proposing to show 
(unless cpu type &amp; clock have been explicitly overridden by the user which
is pretty rare).

If there's no clear use for the extra information, I'd rather leave it out
as UI clutter.


If others think the information is userful, I think it would be clearer
if for 68000 it would just skip &quot;000&quot;.  The information might also be
clearer if separated with &quot;/&quot;:
	8Mhz/4MB ST, TOS v1.02
	32Mhz/030/14MB TT, EmuTOS
	16Mhz/040/8MB Falcon, EmuTOS

What do you think?


&gt;<i> LED are a bit smaller now.
</I>
They were wide to look more like (Atari) leds. :-)


&gt;<i> In additional, statusbar is visible  
</I>&gt;<i> only in windowed mode, in fullscreen we can see overlay led. This is more
</I>&gt;<i> pleasure, especially during watching demos/games.
</I>
You can switch statusbar to led from command line and from the options GUI.

Currently led drawing has more overhead than statusbar, that's why I don't
like it being hardcoded to be mode dependent.

If you want that kind of a change, you need to make it to be configurable
separately for fullscreen and windowed mode + allow changing them
from the options GUI.  The main issue is where in the GUI you can fit
the extra option(s)...

Current command line options can still set both at the same.


&gt;<i> Attached you can find mixed screen for ST/TT/Falcon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What you think about including that mod into Hatari?
</I>
The code itself look fine.  For patches, please send them in future
in unified context diff format (diff -u).

Only thing that was strange was this, what it's for?
+
+       Statusbar_UpdateInfo();
        Statusbar_ShowMessage(surf, currentticks);

(It should be called from appropriate places _outside_ statusbar.c.)
