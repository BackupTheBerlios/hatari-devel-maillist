</I>&gt;<i> Hi!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see, I never took into account that there should be centering around a
</I>&gt;<i> 160 byte scanline (or even 168 byte on STe), it complicate things for
</I>&gt;<i> sure. Epecially as the cycle counting needs to be centered as well so

Hello,

Yes, I see you're starting to see where're the problems :) This is why 
it's important to know at what cycle the display starts and to respect 
this in the emulation, even if the resulting picture looks a little &quot;off 
centered&quot;.
This effect can be seen also with spectrum512 like pictures ; in that 
case, even a 1 pixel shift will make the result looks completly wrong 
(that was a problem with paulo simoes overscan demos) (you can see this by 
changing hscroll on STE and trying to display a spec512 picture).

Other small (but very important) difference is that in 60 Hz, displays 
starts 4 cycles earlier (and as this mode is often used to reduce color 
flicker in spec512 mode ...)

So, lots of things to take care of that you never take into account when 
directly coding on st, and no real documentation for that, but that's the 
fun of emulation, building your own tools to measure the inner working of 
the machine :)


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For some help I have compared the original last fullscreen picture from
</I>&gt;<i> MOLZ to a STe-capture of the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It looks like there are indeed about six pixels cut off at the right part
</I>&gt;<i> of the image. The left part seems intact.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here is the comparison: <A HREF="http://ae.dhs.nu/pics/missing_pixels.png">http://ae.dhs.nu/pics/missing_pixels.png</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also taking into account that the capture-picture is &lt;416 pixels and
</I>&gt;<i> scaled to that level anyway, those six pixels missing might grow to about
</I>&gt;<i> 8. This sux :)  408 pixels and not 416 displayed as I had always thought.
</I>&gt;<i> It could perhaps be sensible to limit Hataris window to 408 pixels if that
</I>&gt;<i> really is all a real machine can see.
</I>
Thanks very much for this ; this in fact confirms what I observed with the 
video you took of my test program, where I saw an 8 pixels shift 
(something similar to the hi/lo switch technique that can be used on STF 
to do 4 pixels horizontal scrolling).
I will try to mix all this to improve Hatari's rendering.
