<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; Hmm. I have never heard of this issue, but I use a third-party library
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; for the dialogs in windows anyway, i.e. there is not much I can do about
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hard to believe it would be a Hatari specific issue.  Which UI library
</I>&gt;<i> you're using?
</I>
I don't think this is a Hatari specific issue. What I meant is that even
if it is a general issue (which I expect it to be) I cannot easily
address this because the UI library code is not mine. It's the latest
version of CF-Lib by Christian Felsch.

&gt;<i> I added a note about this to todo.txt.  First step would probably be adding
</I>&gt;<i> tracing also to the IDE layer.
</I>
Also not my email with the code fragment for WIN_FORMAT. This fragment
is most likely everything that's needed. It works basically the same as
writing sectors with a particular pattern, but from an applications
(i.e. drivers's) perspective that's what formatting actually does.

&gt;<i> However, based on your above comments there could still be quite a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> work and the advantage of having SCSI support too is not so large as the
</I>&gt;<i> disk image contents can be accessed also through IDE interface...
</I>
I agree. Implementing SCSI might be interesting, but it does not provide
any real benefit. Except for learning a lot about SCSI, of course.
I hope something can be done about ACSI not working with TOS 3.06 and
HDDRIVER. Using an IDE image as a boot device is only possible with TOS
4.04 but not with TOS 2.0x or 3.0x, and without ACSI working one cannot
boot from a hard disk drive image at all with HDDRIVER and TOS 2.0x/3.0x.

&gt;<i> &gt; For me booting from an IDE drive image in Falcon-compatible mode with an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; original TOS 4.04 works fine.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think that works because TOS 4 supports IDE (but HD Driver doesn't work in
</I>&gt;<i> Hatari with TOS 4).  So I'm mainly interested about why it doesn't work with
</I>&gt;<i> the ACSI mode...
</I>
Yes, exactly, see my comment above.

But nevertheless I can boot from an IDE image with TOS 4.04 and HDDRIVER, i.e.
I could not observe anything wrong with HDDRIVER/Hatari/TOS 4. What
exactly is your problem? Note that when using HDRIVER with TOS 4.04 you
must ensure that the CPU is at least an 68030, i.e. you must enable the
68040 setting.

Best regards

Uwe
