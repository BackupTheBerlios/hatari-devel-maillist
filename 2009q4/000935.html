Games
----------

RG's Bugger, Bunion, Sky Fall, Sworm and Bubble Bobble games all work slow,
but fine.

They're so slow on my machine that it's hard to say about the sound quality 
anything else than that I think it resembles music. :-)

Music in Blum game seems to be &quot;working&quot; now.

Paradize's ChainZ and JewelZ work now with sound, &quot;Hatari mode&quot; isn't
anymore needed.

There's music in H2O and Push It games (wasn't earlier).

Music in the Aggression's Cavemania game demo works.

Gravon demo works for the first time (and with music).

Tecknoball works now too (uses Gramouf tracker).


Demos
----------

Aggression party 2 invite music works.

DNT Crew's Agony demo has now music.

EKO's Epidemic music demo has now music, but still doesn't work
otherwise (illegal ROM accesses).

Toons' Yepyha demo has now music, but still doesn't work otherwise.

Mouse music works (and sounds fine as this takes much less CPU
than the other things).

JESTERday music demo music works.


So, great progress!


T.O.Y.S &quot;Wait&quot; (with NoCrew MP2-player) and tSCc's Beams music still
doesn't work although the demos work otherwise.


	- Eero

PS. I also tested a couple of other programs on random.  &quot;Conquest of
Elysium II&quot; stops on second menu, but that's even without DSP (this is
not supposed to need DSP).
