I think % would be better used as binary prefix, I'm not sure anyone uses 
modulo.

I never needed float point when doing asm in atari, I don't think we 
will need it in the debugger to fix some problems related to hatari.

I'm not sure we should put too much extra evaluate commands in hatari ; of 
course it's your time, so you're free to do it, but in the end I think 
they're some much more complete calculators solutions that the user can 
run from another terminal if he really wants to (adding that to the fact 
that debugger mode is used by a very low percentage of users I guess)

Apart from simple operations/conversions, I think we should not transform 
hatari in a HP48 calculator :)

No, but according to monitor.berlios.de, quite a lot of servers were down. 
A little disappointing it took them more than 48h to bring it up.
