</I>
I think it's better if you just add them to a file and then tell Hatari to
(re)load that.  And if it's in a regular program you're running from
a desktop, it may end up in another address, then you need on each
load to give some offset for it.

Btw.  I'm now thinking that the program offset could be actually something
that's handled on the host side with some trivial helper scripts, Hatari 
debugger would be given just a list of absolute RAM addresses.  Debugger
itself would support only one list of symbols at the time to simplify things
(joining &amp; offsetting the addresses can be done trivially with AWK, outside
of Hatari).


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; A real native debugger can also support non intrusive breakpoints,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; breakpoints on data changes, conditional breakpoints that do not hog
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the machine, etc....
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hatari debugger already supports these features.  I added them to v1.3
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with help from the others. (ideas mostly from Nicolas, and generic
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; debugging support from Thomas).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So much then for the &quot;hatari debugger is far to be as advanced as monst2&quot;
</I>
It's still lacking a lot of features that Monst2 has though.

See my earlier &quot;atari debugger improvements&quot; mail.
