<PRE>Hi,

</I>
Well, the calculator already supported octal, adding support for that to
debugger parsing would have been just couple of lines (scanf()).

But I removed octal &amp; ascii support from calculator along with
modulo &amp; power operations.  I'll continue removing more features
from it to make it simpler.

I also changed  &lt; &amp; &gt; operators to move familiar &lt;&lt; &amp; &gt;&gt; operators.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conversion accuracy) and that shift and logical OR &amp; AND

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; point calculations aren't needed, I could change everything to

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I rather wonder whether we need negative numbers in the debugger?
</I>
To store intermediate calculation results that are negative?
I'll try with long longs.


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I'm not sure we should put too much extra evaluate commands in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; hatari ; of course it's your time, so you're free to do it, but in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; the end I think they're some much more complete calculators
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; solutions that the user can run from another terminal if he really
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; wants to (adding that to the fact that debugger mode is used by a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; very low percentage of users I guess)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I second that.
</I>
Well, it works fine already. :-)  I'm just in process of integrating it
better to Hatari and removing redundant features in the process.

Supporting the same internal Hatari variables as conditional breakpoints
does might be a useful new feature though for things like video line cycle
calculation.


&gt;<i> &gt; Is there any free calculator that supports both binary &amp; shift
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; operations and oct/dec/hex modes conveniently?  I haven't found any.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Both, gcalctool and galculator support binary, oct and hex modes, too.
</I>&gt;<i> None of them is perfect, but using both, I always got finally the
</I>&gt;<i> result of my calculations.
</I>
Haven't used either as they seem to be GUI tools.  Do they have history?
