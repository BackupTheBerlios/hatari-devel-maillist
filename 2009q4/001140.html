<PRE>Hi,

On Thursday 24 December 2009, <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/hatari-devel">npomarede at corp.free.fr</A> wrote:
&gt;<i> this may be feasible, but is it really useful ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Apart from the complexity to load/parse the different debug symbols

</I>&gt;<i> different format), what will it be used for ?
</I>
According to my DevpacST 2 manual, it supports the DRI debugging symbol
standard and HiSoft extended version.  It also mentions that about
everything supports the DRI standard, so I think DRI support could be
enough.

OS header contains pointer to currently running process basepage and that
contains pointers to program text and data sections, so if user gives just
the currently running process filename (could be a copy of the file if one's
running it from a disk image), symbols can be loaded directly from it and
mapped based on text &amp; data section addresses.  It doesn't necessarily need
hooking anything inside emulation.

But if the native debuggers are indeed better, then it doesn't make sense.


&gt;<i> In any case, it won't be possible to use this with existing games/demos,
</I>&gt;<i> so only case would be for programs compiled with debug symbols (I don't
</I>&gt;<i> think there're a lot of them) or for homemade asm programs that users
</I>&gt;<i> would compile from their own sources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But in that case, I think that adebog or monst are way more powerful than
</I>&gt;<i> Hatari debugger,
</I>
According to Vincent (sorry, I didn't quote his whole mail previously),
Monst2 doesn't work with 040 and it supports only ST video modes. 
What about adebug?


&gt;<i> with a built in window system,
</I>
Things could even be shown on specific parts of the screen if Hatari
dependency to ncurses is OK, but that could constrict the area for other
outputs (help texts etc) and require changing a lot of code, so I'd skip
that, at least for now.

(I think that kind of stuff would be a better in a separate GUI debugger
that works over the Hatari control socket.)


&gt;<i> register locking,
</I>
Hatari debugger already supports showing different kinds of invormation
when entering the debugger.

And what's shown when entering the debugger could be configurable (regs,
memdump, disassembly, for CPU and/or DSP).  It could be based on
the register values too (address in register N).

The hard part isn't in implementing that, but getting a good syntax on how
to specify it to the debugger...


&gt;<i> search  in disasm mode, ...
</I>
Byte search could also be implemented.  With an option for using word
boundary for searching instruction opcodes.

Doing it based on using assembler instructions (instead of opcodes) like is
possible in Monst would probably be too complicated though, unless somebody
wants to write the lookup tables needed for this...


&gt;<i> I really used a lot of this some years ago and I don't see how adding
</I>&gt;<i> symbol to hatari debugger would make it much useful than debugging
</I>&gt;<i> directly under the emulated atari, there so much power in monst that
</I>&gt;<i> making Hatari at the same level would be a huge task.
</I>
After digging my Devpac manual from the attic, I went through it and checked
what other features Hatari debugger is currently missing in addition to
above listed ones:

1. Showing PC and breakpoints positions in the disassembly output.
   -&gt; easy at least for PC and address breakpoints
2. Counting breakpoints.
3. Stopping at breakpoint only after it's been passed certain number
   of times.
   -&gt; 2) &amp; 3) are trivial to do too, but need to be done separately
        for CPU, DSP and conditional breakpoints
4. Breakpoints that act only once (and disappears after a hit?)
5. Shortcut for telling to run until given (temporary breakpoint)
    condition is hit.
   -&gt; Would be trivial to do after 4)
6. Running until code returns from ROM (exiting from super mode?)
7. Single stepping that skips Traps, Line-A, Line-F. And one that
    skips also BSRs and JSRs.
8. Set breakpoint to next instruction and run (to skip loops)
9. Set breakpoint on specific OS call
10. Run slowly
11. Showing contents of memory pointed by the registers
12. Saving machine status to history buffer each time debugger is
      entered (exception or breakpoint is hit) and being able to view
      this history
13. SP &amp; SSP as CPU register names (active &amp; supervisor stack)
13. Fill and copy memory

Although all together these are quite a lot of added code and complexity,
each individual feature is pretty easy to do.  Which of them you would
prioritize?

(The hard thing would again be what kind of a syntax one would use for
specifying them to Hatari...)


Btw. Monst manual mentioned couple of things that could be nice in Hatari
debugger.  For example:
* Running until code gets out of ROM:
	SP = A7
* Running until subroutine ends (RTS=0x4e75):
	(PC).w = 0x4e75  &amp;&amp;  SP &gt; CURRENT_SP_MINUS_ONE
