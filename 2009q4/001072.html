Hello,

this is strange, the non working screens are now ok for me (for example 
the picture asking to insert disk 2 in MOLZ).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Result should be close to a real STE, except for the 16 first displayed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pixels that show 2 bitplanes under Hatari (under STE, this seems to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> completly show the background color, I'm not sure if it's the case ?).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hum, this seems to be perhaps a wrong approach, on the STe the screen is

</I>&gt;<i> garbage with a traditional 230 byte overscan are now displaying perfectly
</I>&gt;<i> looking graphics.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To put it short, the pixels lost at the left are gained at the right. So
</I>&gt;<i> as I see it, Hatari should just show the usual 416px screen and adjust the
</I>&gt;<i> raster position by N cycles.
</I>
You mean on STE the screen is shifted to the left (not to the right) ? 
Else I don't understand how the far right pixels would be more visible.


&gt;<i> Oh and by the way, the leftmost part of the screen (before the graphics
</I>&gt;<i> begin) shows the background colour on a real STe, not that it should
</I>&gt;<i> matter for Hatari as this part shouldn't be displayed in normal cases.
</I>
Yes, I had a doubt on this ; I will clear the corresponding 2 bitplanes on 
the left.

How do you count 416 pixels ? 224 bytes would give 448 pixels, and as the 
first 16 are background ones, this would leave 432. Do you count only 
usable pixels ? (I count 8 pixels per bytes, even if the hi/lo switch are 
sometimes adding some black bars or things like that).

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And now to something completely different.. It's soon christmas, so here
</I>&gt;<i> goes some wishes that would ease coding fullscreens quite a bit :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * A mode where Hatari shows all 512x313 pixels, with the &quot;non visible&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> areas  toned out to say half brightness. This way one can easily follow
</I>&gt;<i> every clock cycle graphicly. A popular way to determine rastertime is to change
</I>&gt;<i> the background colour, today one can't see that if it's outside the
</I>&gt;<i> visible area, as an example.
</I>
You can try to increase nWindowBorderPixelsLeft / nWindowBorderPixelsRight 
in the config file. I never try to increase them to the equivalent of 512 
bytes per line, but this could work.

But on real ST, you wouldn't change the color outside the visible area, 
or you wouldn't see the colors there too. Do you mean something that would 
use Hatari in a way a nomal ST can't be used ?


&gt;<i> * Fullscreen mode not to crop any pixels - on OS X today Hatari in a
</I>&gt;<i> window crawls. Doing fastforward increases perhaps the speed by 20%, while
</I>&gt;<i> in fullscreen it screams. However in fullscreen it's missing a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> pixels.
</I>
Can't say, I run linux and don't have such problem. I don't know anything 
about the OSX port.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok I'll stop now, thanks again for working on this overscan mode :-)
