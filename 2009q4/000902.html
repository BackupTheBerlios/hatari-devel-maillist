<PRE>Hi,

As this might be of more generic interest (and to make sure the information
gets archived), I'm CC'ing this to hatari-devel.

I also split the GEMDOS issues to a separate mail.

Nicolas &amp; Thomas, any comments on this?

</I>
Hard to believe it would be a Hatari specific issue.  Which UI library
you're using?


&gt;<i> &gt; * Trying to format a HDD image created with &quot;atari-hd-image.sh&quot; (has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; DOS partition table &amp; FAT formatting) gives &quot;Couldn't format the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Medium&quot;. I guess Hatari is missing support for some IDE commands. If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you can check what these are, I can at least add a TODO about this to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hatari.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In general HDDRUTIL always works with SCSI commands, even when addressing
</I>&gt;<i> IDE or ATAPI drives. The SCSI driver integrated in HDDRIVER will convert
</I>&gt;<i> these commands to the corresponding (as far as possible) IDE or ATAPI
</I>&gt;<i> commands. This emulation supports the following IDE commands, i.e.
</I>&gt;<i> HDDRIVER expects at least some of these IDE opcodes to be supported as
</I>&gt;<i> defined in the IDE/ATA sspecification:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> $01, $20, $24, $29, $30, $34, $39, $42, $50,
</I>&gt;<i> $97, $C4, $C5, $C6, $DE, $DF, $E3, $E7, $EC
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not all of them must be emulated in order for HDDRIVER to see a fully
</I>&gt;<i> working IDE drive, but the more the better. Some opcodes are only
</I>&gt;<i> relevant for drives with removable media.
</I>&gt;<i> When formatting in particular $50, $EC and the commands for writing
</I>&gt;<i> sectors must work. And the status information returned in the drive's
</I>&gt;<i> status register must make sense, of course.
</I>&gt;<i> By enabling hataris debug output for the IDE port you can most likely
</I>&gt;<i> see which command is failing.
</I>
[...later mail...]
&gt;<i> I had a look at ide.c: The IDE format track command (WIN_FORMAT in ide.c)
</I>&gt;<i> is not implemented, and that's why HDDRUTIL reports that the drive could
</I>&gt;<i> not be formatted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just implementing this command ($50) as a no-operation command might
</I>&gt;<i> work, but only if the emulated drive reports meaningful parameters for
</I>&gt;<i> the number of cylinders and tracks because in contrast to SCSI with IDE
</I>&gt;<i> each track has to be formatted separately. It must also be ensured that
</I>&gt;<i> the emulated drive accepts the data to be written to the track to be
</I>&gt;<i> formatted. In contrast to SCSI with IDE the sector data to be written
</I>&gt;<i> when formatting have to be provided explicitly. So IDE formatting is
</I>&gt;<i> similar to writing a number of sectors (as many sectors as a track has
</I>&gt;<i> sectors) to an IDE drive.
</I>
I added a note about this to todo.txt.  First step would probably be adding
tracing also to the IDE layer.


&gt;<i> As far as hard disks are concerned it would be nice if hatari also
</I>&gt;<i> supported the SCSI bus. Implementing an SCSI emulation is most likely a
</I>&gt;<i> demanding task, but it's probably very interesting. Getting an SCSI
</I>&gt;<i> emulation to work with HDDRIVER is particularly difficult because
</I>&gt;<i> HDDRIVER (and CBHD) in contrast to any other driver for the Atari make
</I>&gt;<i> use of SCSI messages and in contrast to AHDI expect the drive to control
</I>&gt;<i> the SCSI bus phases, just like the standard says.
</I>
It's already on the TODO list, but I haven't heard of anybody interested in
implementing it.  Aranym doesn't seem to support SCSI, but Qemu seems to,
so there may be some example code (IDE code was taken from Qemu).

However, based on your above comments there could still be quite a lot of
work and the advantage of having SCSI support too is not so large as the
disk image contents can be accessed also through IDE interface...


&gt;<i> &gt; * For images done with atari-hd-image.sh, HDDRUTIL.APP shows in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; partitioning dialog the drive size always to be 32MB, even for 8 and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 16MB drives (which have smaller number of cylinders although otherwise
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the drive geometry is same). Partition size is fine though.  Is this a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bug in HD Driver?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When creating an image file of 8 MB with dd the partitioning dialog
</I>&gt;<i> tells me the correct size. What does HDDRUTIL say about the drive
</I>&gt;<i> geometry? Use &quot;Tools-&gt;IDE Hard Disks&quot; to retrieve this information.
</I>
The drive geometry seems OK:
	Heads: 16, sectors: 32, cylinders: 31 (should be 32?)

I think the partitioning thing might be confused by the information on
the disk.  I'm not completely sure this is the right thing to do, but it was
the only way I could get things to work with mkdosfs &amp; mtools (-A is needed,
and it implies these things) in atari-hd-image script:
--------------
# mkdosfs keeps the sector count below 32765 when -A is used by increasing
# the logical sector size (this is for TOS compatibility, -A guarantees
# also 2 sectors / cluster and Atari serial number etc).  Mtools barfs
# if partition size doesn't divide evenly with its track size.  Determine
# suitable cluster count &amp; corresponding track size and align (decrease)
# the file system sector count accordingly.
tracksize=32
clustertmp=$((sectors/2))
echo &quot;Sectors: $sectors, sectors/track: $tracksize, clusters: $clustertmp&quot;
while [ $clustertmp -gt 32765 ]; do
        clustertmp=$((clustertmp/2))
        tracksize=$(($tracksize*2))
        echo &quot;Doubling sector size as &gt;32765 clusters -&gt; $clustertmp 
clusters&quot;
done
origsectors=$sectors
sectors=$(($sectors/$tracksize))
sectors=$(($sectors*$tracksize))
kilobytes=$(($sectors/2))
if [ $sectors -ne $origsectors ]; then
        echo &quot;Align sector count with clusters/sectors/track: 
$origsectors -&gt; $sectors ($kilobytes kB)&quot;
fi
echo &quot;mkdosfs -A -F $fatbits -n $partname -C $tmppart $kilobytes&quot;
mkdosfs -A -n $partname -C $tmppart $kilobytes
--------------


&gt;<i> &gt; * Unlike with AHDI and Cecile, booting from a drive image which has
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  HD Driver installed doesn't work.  Drive isn't recognized either in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ACSI or IDE mode.  Thomas, any idea why?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For me booting from an IDE drive image in Falcon-compatible mode with an
</I>&gt;<i> original TOS 4.04 works fine.
</I>
I think that works because TOS 4 supports IDE (but HD Driver doesn't work in
Hatari with TOS 4).  So I'm mainly interested about why it doesn't work with
the ACSI mode...
