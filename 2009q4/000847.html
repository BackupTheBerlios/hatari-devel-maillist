<PRE>Hi,

Truth to be told, I'm not so fond of it either (and don't use them in my own
projects[1]), but I think inconsistent naming conventions in source code are
even worse.  Renaming everything in current Hatari code base not to have
prefixes doesn't seem reasonable either.


Btw. another thing I haven't see elsewhere is prefixing also static
functions. And CamelCaps use differs from project to project, I've never
used it in my own projects.  In general it seems to be used more in C++
projects, maybe due to C++ being originally used more on Windows because
of MFC.

My own prefences match the Linux kernel coding guideline:
	<A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle">http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle</A>

(Except for typedefs. In kernel there's a good reason not to hide structs
with typedefs because they can have performance overhead, I think in user
space readability matters more.)


&gt;<i> What is useful is the context in which the variable is used, and this
</I>&gt;<i> should be enough IMO to see what a variable is for and what type it is
</I>&gt;<i> (thing like &quot;if (AviRecording==true)&quot; are enough to see we're dealing
</I>&gt;<i> with a boolean I think)
</I>
If you have a global function named AviRecording, then smallcaps b in
the beginning of the corresponding variable helps differentiating it.
Depending on context, compiler might not warn you about that.


&gt;<i> I know this is a matter of choice, but I really find this notation to be
</I>&gt;<i> redundant. If some variables need to go from 16 bits int to 32, should we
</I>&gt;<i> rename all prefixes from &quot;w&quot; to &quot;dw&quot; ? What matters most to understand
</I>&gt;<i> the code is the stored value, not really the storage size.
</I>
If boolean changes to something else, I think the name of the variable
should indeed change (and not just whatever prefix it has). :-)
