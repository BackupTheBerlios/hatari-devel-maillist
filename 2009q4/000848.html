<PRE>Hi,

</I>
Ah, I see.


&gt;<i> So, you will get the same thing in your avi file as what was displayed on
</I>&gt;<i> the screen. And if you play the avi, you will get what you saw on screen
</I>&gt;<i> while recording (that is same skipping effect).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not sure we should add a dialog for this ; I will mention in the doc
</I>&gt;<i> that frameskip should be off for best results, but if a user want to
</I>&gt;<i> record anyway with frameskip to be able to play a game in &quot;real time&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> why not ? I don't think we should turn off fskip automatically.
</I>
Ok, seems reasonable.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If frame skipping is constant (that is 25 fps for example), it is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; theorically possible to mix 25 fps video with 50 &quot;fps&quot; audio, but the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; use case is not worth the coding complexity.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In this case, how &quot;--avi-fps&quot; / &quot;AviRecordDefaultFps&quot; can work?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Shouldn't the recording FPS rate be then taken directly from the Hatari
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; internal screen update frequency  (nScreenRefreshRate: 50, 60, 71Hz)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is what is done in most cases,
</I>
I see, &quot;AviRecordDefaultFps&quot; is used only when AVI recording is started
immediately from main.c.  when doing it from the GUI, nScreenRefreshRate
is used.

Btw. Should the AVI codec, cropping and file name be saved to the
configuration file too?


&gt;<i> but as I wrote in a previous mail, if the first frames you're recording
</I>&gt;<i> are 60 Hz and the rest is 50 Hz, this can help to force the FPS in the avi
</I>&gt;<i> header. Of course, the 60 Hz frames will look like being played to slow,
</I>&gt;<i> but then the 50 Hz frames will be fine.
</I>
Would it make sense to print a warning when this happens?

If (nScreenRefreshRate != avi-&gt;Fps &amp;&amp; nScreenRefreshRate != 
avi-&gt;warnedRefreshRate) {
	Log_Printf(LOG_WARN, &quot;Screen Refresh Rate (%d) and AVI FPS (%d) don't 
match!\n&quot;, nScreenRefreshRate, avi-&gt;Fps);
	avi-&gt;warnedRefreshRate = nScreenRefreshRate;
}


&gt;<i> Only use I see for this is when you want to record an Atari after reboot.
</I>&gt;<i> In that case, the shifter starts at 60 Hz, then goes to 50 Hz latter
</I>&gt;<i> (depending on your country). But as the booting phase only display a
</I>&gt;<i> white screen, you won't be able to notice you're playing 60 Hz at 50 Hz.
</I>&gt;<i> If we had used nScreenRefreshRate in that case, the whole video would be
</I>&gt;<i> marked as 60 Hz and would look bad when played.
</I>
Can't some demos also change the refresh rate (say Falcon ones)?

In this case the warning about refresh rate change would be good so that one
can better decide which refresh rate would be best to be used (after seeing
what is used most and when the changes happen).
