Hello

it's true that David patch was not included so far ; I still have to 
ponder if it's better to use this patch or to use volume tables as 
measured on a real ST.

This patch improves linear mixing in the sense that instead of 
summing/averaging volumes it also applies a filter similar to the one in 
the ST. But it doesn't take into account the period of each voice in 
this operation.

Final output signal depends on the volume of the 3 voices, but also on 
the period of each of this voice, as all 3 of them are wired together 
and the feedback effect will be different when freq changes.

So, regarding quality, I think we have this choices (from lower to better) :

  - linear mixing
  - david's version with filter
  - table mixing measured on a real ST

But even the 3rd method is not perfect, because those tables are often 
built for 1 or 2 different frequencies (per=0 and per!=0)

Sound conversion from digital to &quot;analog&quot; (ie the ST's signal) is a 
complex matter, it's quite subjective and hard to build a good model 
that reproduces the wiring &quot;errors&quot; in the ST.
