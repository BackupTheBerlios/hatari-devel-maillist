<PRE>OK I agree with your point of view. it makes sense.

But actually, I'm not sure I've included everything needed and perhaps some non useful code.

&quot;Generic&quot; CPU is running in the current Hatari V5 version (all 68x00 cores, FPUs, 68030 + MMU)
Not running cores are cycles exacts (all generations) and 68040 specific MMU

Maybe I've included some unuseful garbage and haven't included some needed functions.

The problem is that WinUae's code seems not well structurated to me.
There's code everywhere and many includes that include other include ... for some functions.

I think that it'll be necessary to have an other look at this new core to decide the version we want to keep and work with.

I'll try to upload the new release tomorrow (or beginning of the next week).

Regards

Laurent

Le 06/10/2011 12:23, <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/hatari-devel">laurent.sallafranque at free.fr</A> a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how are you doing your merge ? Are you trying to replace all files in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cpu/ with the new one from WinUae and repatch them ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If so, I think that's the wrong method. You should do a diff between the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> original WinUAE files (that are currently used in Hatari 1.5) and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> files from the latest WinUAE release.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That's the way I do it.
</I>&gt;<i> It does less work and I'm more sure it will compile at the end.
</I>&gt;<i> But they've done some changes in do_interrupts and exceptions that I have to integrate.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've solved my problem this morning.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I still have 5 errors I'll try to fix tomorrow.
</I>&gt;<i> Then, I'll test everything and commit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Then, the hard work will start.
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes, I'd like to clean all their code and just keep the nessessary code for Hatari.
</I>&gt;<i> (I think there won't be major changes in the main core of winuae).
</I>&gt;<i> Would you agree with that ?
</I>&gt;<i> (The actual code is full of Winuae specific code)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We could then fork and maintain our own ATARI core (and patch only specific changes if there are).
</I>
I'm not sure there won't be major changes in WinUAE one day (on the 
contrary to UAE which will certainly not evolve anymore), so I think it 
would be a better idea to try to keep all the WinUAE code to be able to 
have more undertsandable diffs when you go from one version to another.

Instead of removing code, I think it would be better to add some
#ifdef HATARI_CPU to add specific part for Hatari and #ifndef HATARI_CPU 
to keep Amiga's specific part.

If you remove code, I think we could discover in some months that some 
parts that were not correctly understood today were in fact necessary, 
and adding them back could be a problem if the structure of the code was 
changed too much in Hatari.

Also, WinUAE's cpu core is the only maintaned 680xx core today, forking 
it doesn't seem wise to me, it would be better to stay as close to it as 
possible, and even to contribute patches in case we see some emulation 
error/imprecisions (I know I found a lot of error in UAE's 68000 core, 
and some of them were still in WinUAE (that was some times ago, maybe 
it's fixed now)).
(for example, if the FPU cycles are not correct now, it's possible a new 
version of WinUAE will handle that ; it could also handle 68060 in the 
future and we would benefit from it)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I give you some news of my current work : I'm merging the latest winuae
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> core to hatari.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I encounter a problem with newcpu.c
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While compiling, I get the following error (the same kind of error
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> occurs in many places in the code) :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /home/laurent/Atari/Compare/hatari-2011-09-28/src/cpu/newcpu.c:3563:30:

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> /home/laurent/Atari/Compare/hatari-2011-09-28/src/cpu/newcpu.c:3563:30:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> error: too many arguments to function &#8216;do_interrupt&#8217;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If I look at the code near the 3563 line, it's an area of comments,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there's no instruction.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I guess I've got a problem with a .h file ( a missing ; for example).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> likely that the new set of files will also compile (WinUAE often does
</I>&gt;<i> only small changes in the cpu part between different releases).
