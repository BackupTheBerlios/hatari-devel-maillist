Hello

Maybe rework the acia/ikbd communication parts, there're still some 
problems there, we regularly get reports of programs that gets broken 
after we &quot;fix&quot; something in the ikbd. Timings and emulation of the acia 
control registers are not right, I would need to write some 68000 test 
programs to precisely measure several cases on a real ST and check we 
get the same behaviour under Hatari (definitly a boring task, but this 
has to be done :) )

Let's see also if we get better sound options for the analog voices mixing.

IKBD and FDC should give huge improvements for people playing games in 
Hatari ; so far my focus was mainly on demos, as they require very 
precise emulation and exhibit a lot of video/cpu cases.

But IKBD and FDC are 2 of the oldest components that were not really 
refactored recently and they still carry some limitations/errors from 
the original Winston sources (that's done for FDC now, but IKBD remains)


&gt;<i> [1] Nicolas, recording and replaying mouse events would be
</I>&gt;<i>      really nice...  Do you have any thoughts on best way to
</I>&gt;<i>       do that?
</I>
In ikbdc.c, you could try to intercept when we write the byte in 
$fffc02. This byte is the result of pressing a key or moving the mouse 
on the host computer (through SDL).

So, if each time a byte is written to be &quot;sent&quot; to the ST you store the 
VBL number, the video cycle number in this number and the byte, you 
should be able to record a precise flow of the bytes sents to the ST.

But if you do this in IKBD_InterruptHandler_ACIA / 
bByteInTransitToACIA==true, you might record also the bytes sent by the 
ikbd, which is not what you want, so you better record bytes in 
IKBD_SendAutoKeyboardCommands when IKBD_UpdateInternalMousePosition is 
called (this would filter mouse only events, but requires quite some 
plumbing anyway)
