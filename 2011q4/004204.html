<PRE>Le 20/11/2011 22:32, David Savinkoff a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> It would be better if SDL did not need
</I>&gt;<i> dc blocking.
</I>&gt;<i> ********
</I>
What DC blocking for SDL are you talking about ? I don't hear any click 
as you report.


&gt;<i> Anyway, if this patch is &quot;mathematically&quot; more correct than the previous
</I>&gt;<i> one, I can apply it, it's just that I don't hear the differences (maybe
</I>&gt;<i> others do ? You can try by getting hatari 1.5 sources and applying the 3
</I>&gt;<i> patches sent on 4/11/2011 by David).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> By the way, you say this emulates an RC filter ; but what are the values
</I>&gt;<i> for R and C in the case of your patch ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ***DS***
</I>&gt;<i> This patch is mathematically more correct because it emulates analog
</I>&gt;<i> electronics with transfer functions based on actual circuits.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For the Atari STf: (using ac/dc analysis and transistor gain)
</I>&gt;<i> R is about 3800 ohms and C is 100 microfarads.
</I>&gt;<i> This would make a high pass filter cutoff frequency of:
</I>&gt;<i> f = 1/(2*pi*3800*100e-6) = 0.42 Hz. My filter is measured to be 11 Hz.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My frequency is better because:
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Atari could have done better with a 3.9 microfarad capacitor.
</I>&gt;<i> --- DC blocking should be a reasonable subsonic filter because
</I>&gt;<i> --- very low frequencies are indistinguishable from DC.
</I>&gt;<i> 2) This filter is to prevent SDL from popping and clicking. (see 1)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One can test the sound by replacing C11 on an STf (see schematics)
</I>&gt;<i> with a 25 volt, 3.9 microfarad multilayer ceramic capacitor.
</I>&gt;<i> *******
</I>
You say your frequency is better, but as we want to emulate close to the 
real ST, can you get a frequency that is the same ? (I agree that the 
original ST could have been better, but we must emulate the sound people 
are used to, not necessarily improve their old design).

Regarding the 2 filters from the schematics (ST and mega ST, but they're 
similar, mega ST is more readable), they contain several R and C. Do you 
mean your RC with 3800/100 filter behaves the same as all those 
components (my electronic studies are a little too far away to check this) ?

Thanks

Nicolas

PS : any hope you could have access to a mail system that correctly 
quote and indent answer ? This might be your ISP's fault, but it's very 
hard to follow such mails, as they don't get the usual &quot;color + 
indentation&quot; look from most email reader.
