<PRE>Good job Nicolas,

I'll test this week end (and I'll spend some time with the games by the same time :)

I'll tell you the results monday.

Regards

Laurent

Objet: [hatari-devel] New FDC emulation

Hello

After seeing a lot of bug reports about games not running under Hatari, 
due to uncomplete emulation of the WD1772, I committed the result of my 
work during the latest weeks.

The fdc.c emulation has been nearly completly rewritten, with accuracy 
in mind regarding registers emulation, delays and dma transfers.

The general structure of the file was kept, as it's a state machine that 
was already close to the WD1772 docs, but all inner work was changed.

The FDC now supports all type I/I/III/IV commands (except the Write 
Track command, as it doesn't make many sense with the ST/MSA disk images).

Precise delays are emulated to start the motor, spin up the disk, stop 
the motor after last command, move the head, read/write sectors and read 
track/address, etc.

All transfers between disk and RAM are emulating the DMA, bytes are 
handled by blocks of 16 bytes, dma address is correctly updated all 
along while processing a command.

Status Register should now behave like a real FDC, read sector with 
multi bit=1 was completly wrong, and the lack of Read Address / Read 
Track command prevented a lot of cracked games in ST/MSA format to start 
(because the game was still trying to use these command to check for the 
protection, before the result was ignored by the crack).

This allows to run 2 very good demos : &quot;Just Buggin&quot; by ACF and 
&quot;STNICCC&quot; by Oxygene

On the games side, a LOT should now work : Pang (Fuzion 32), The Simpson 
(Fuzion 108), Super Grand Prix (Fuzion 40), Warlock (Fuzion 46), Navy 
Seals (Fuzion 51), Flight Of The Intruder (Fuzion 82), Rbi Baseball 2 
(Fuzion 83), Exile (Fuzion 102), ...

Even some programs like Procopy / Fastcopy / Terminator copy / Diskus 
3.65 can be run in analyze mode and should allow to see the layout of a 
track :)

Correctly emulating the WD1772 took a lot of time to get precise 
timings. At first, I just wanted to add correct Status Register and Read 
Address/Read Track, this fixed a lot of programs, but then some programs 
required correct DMA timings to transfer block of 16 bytes, and some 
copy programs require precise GAPs and delays between successive sector 
reads.
In the end, this led to rewritting nearly everything :)

As Hatari only supports ST/MSA disk images with fixed number of sectors 
per track and 512 bytes per sector, some parts of the FDC are not 
completly generic (but they could be easily updated to support more 
advanced disk image, such as Pasti).

Regarding Pasti, there's no support for it in this new code, Ijor 
(P&#228;sti's author) told me he was still working on releasing an open 
source version of Pasti, so I prefer waiting for this instead of reverse 
engineering the format).

I removed the &quot;--slowfdc&quot; option and replaced it with &quot;--fastfdc&quot; (which 
is off by default). This way, Hatari will start in maximum compatibility 
mode regarding FDC, so users should get the best results out of the box.
If you want faster disk acceses (at the risk of some incompatibilities), 
you can use --fastfdc to speed up most delays by a factor 10.

I updated python-ui and the OSX gui to use this new option.

Could someone test the OSX version (I don't know how to rebuild 
keyedobjects.nib) and post some patches in case it doesn't compile ?


Please, test a lot of demos / games (but mainly games) and report the 
regressions you could see. If some games are still not working, let me 
know, it could be either an error in the new fdc code, or some errors in 
the cpu emulation used by the protection, in either case this need to be 
fixed.


Nicolas
