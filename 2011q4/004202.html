Hello

I got time to test your patch, but I didn't hear such difference as you
said with &quot;7 gates of jambala&quot; in STE mode or SH11INV in STF mode.

At least, that's good news, because there's no quality regression, but I
don't hear differences using headphone.

For instance, I don't understand what you mean by &quot;jump from ear to ear&quot;
? Do you mean sound goes from left channel to right channel ?


***DS***
The effect is subtle, similar to being in a live room, and listening
to the ambience in different locations.
********

If so, that would be a bug in the previous dmaSnd.c file, but not an
effect of the filter. There're 2 functions DmaSnd_LowPassFilterLeft and
DmaSnd_LowPassFilterRight, and as Madness uses stereo output, I don't
see how sound could go from one ear to the other ?


***DS***
The Madness demo is stereo, my filter is after the YM2149 and DMA.
Thus I'm hearing the ambience difference between YM*dc-block +
stereoDMA*no-dc-block And (YM + stereoDMA)*IIR-dc-block.
Mathematically different. It would be better if SDL did not need
dc blocking.
********

Anyway, if this patch is &quot;mathematically&quot; more correct than the previous
one, I can apply it, it's just that I don't hear the differences (maybe
others do ? You can try by getting hatari 1.5 sources and applying the 3
patches sent on 4/11/2011 by David).

By the way, you say this emulates an RC filter ; but what are the values
for R and C in the case of your patch ?


***DS***
This patch is mathematically more correct because it emulates analog
electronics with transfer functions based on actual circuits.

For the Atari STf: (using ac/dc analysis and transistor gain)
R is about 3800 ohms and C is 100 microfarads.
This would make a high pass filter cutoff frequency of:
f = 1/(2*pi*3800*100e-6) = 0.42 Hz. My filter is measured to be 11 Hz.

My frequency is better because:
1) Atari could have done better with a 3.9 microfarad capacitor.
--- DC blocking should be a reasonable subsonic filter because
--- very low frequencies are indistinguishable from DC.
2) This filter is to prevent SDL from popping and clicking. (see 1)

One can test the sound by replacing C11 on an STf (see schematics)
with a 25 volt, 3.9 microfarad multilayer ceramic capacitor.

Thanks

Nicolas

Thanks
