Hello

I got time to test your patch, but I didn't hear such difference as you 
said with &quot;7 gates of jambala&quot; in STE mode or SH11INV in STF mode.

At least, that's good news, because there's no quality regression, but I 
don't hear differences using headphone.

For instance, I don't understand what you mean by &quot;jump from ear to ear&quot; 
? Do you mean sound goes from left channel to right channel ?

If so, that would be a bug in the previous dmaSnd.c file, but not an 
effect of the filter. There're 2 functions DmaSnd_LowPassFilterLeft and 
DmaSnd_LowPassFilterRight, and as Madness uses stereo output, I don't 
see how sound could go from one ear to the other ?

Anyway, if this patch is &quot;mathematically&quot; more correct than the previous 
one, I can apply it, it's just that I don't hear the differences (maybe 
others do ? You can try by getting hatari 1.5 sources and applying the 3 
patches sent on 4/11/2011 by David).

By the way, you say this emulates an RC filter ; but what are the values 
for R and C in the case of your patch ?

Thanks

Nicolas
