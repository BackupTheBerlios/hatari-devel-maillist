<PRE>&gt;<i> Le 20/11/2011 22:32, David Savinkoff a &#233;crit :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> It would be better if SDL did not need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> dc blocking.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ********
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What DC blocking for SDL are you talking about ? I don't hear any click
</I>&gt;<i> as you report.
</I>
If the current dc blocker is disabled there is a lot of clicking.
I actually patched things to test what happens when dc is allowed
through. The result was clicks whenever hatari was paused, and
whenever alsa or SDL decided to mix in extra sound or silence.

It is easier to do things better!

Blocking dc at very low freqencies with high sample rates gets troublesome.
Higher precision is needed for IIR filters, and more taps and precision are
needed for FIR filters. The IIR filter has a measured cutoff at 11 Hz, the
current 512 tap FIR filter is about 22 Hz. The FIR filter will need
512*(22/0.42) = 26819 taps, and the IIR filter may need int64_t.

The reason Atari used a 100uF electrolyic instead of 3.9uF is because
a wet aluminum electrolytic is a very poor capacitor (more like RLC)
100uF is more of an attempt to swamp the resistance and inductance
with excessive capacitance. Thus, in practice, the cutoff frequency
on the hatari is probably ten times higher than 0.42Hz &gt;= 4Hz.

How I derived lumped component value:

Looking at the STf schematic; R8=1K is pulled up by the YM2149 so this
1K is electrcally in parallel with the YM2149 from the perspective of
the -ve end of C11=100uF. R8 can have 2.5volts and 0volts applied to it
at 50% duty cycle with a 5v powersupply. If R8 is pulled up to 2.5 volts
by a series resistor connected to 5.0 volts, that resistor will be
1k (YM2149 looks like 1k when pulling up and infinite otherwise).
Thus the YM2149 looks like 2k on average.

Q1 has an approximate gain of 100 so R12=470 looks like 47k on Q1's
base.

(R8=1k//2k) + (R9=10k//R10=5.1k//47k) = 3817.7 ohms

C11=100uF derated by 40% and designed to swamp its inadequecies by a
factor of 10 was calculated to be 5.7uF by the person who put it there.

Thanks
David

PS:
My lousy mail frustrates me also. It would be a luxury to have a
secure email connection with highlighting. I have to cut and paste
into vim. I think a solution is to save the email source, open it
with kmail, edit, then cut and paste into lousy telus mail.
