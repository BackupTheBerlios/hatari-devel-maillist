<PRE>Le 30/09/2011 23:07, Eero Tamminen a &#233;crit :

&gt;&gt;<i> Apart from SourceForge, I think these are good alternatives:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * www.nongnu.org : Uses pretty much the same web interface as berlios
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    since both are derived from earlier versions of SourceForge, so we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    might feel at home there quite fast. Major drawback: They are very,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    very picky about the GNU philosophie, e.g. we would first need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    replace Linux by GNU/Linux everywhere in our code and documentation,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    and IIRC they prohibit that a program links against a non-free
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    library (which is not a problem for us yet, but we might need this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    one day for Pasti or one of the other disk image libraries).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe also:
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="http://alioth.debian.org/">http://alioth.debian.org/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * github.com or gitorious.org ... we should also consider those if we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    decide to move to git ... I think they are quite popular amongst git
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have some stuff at gitorious.org.  It doesn't have a bug tracker
</I>&gt;<i> nor web page hosting (but you can have wiki pages) which rules it
</I>&gt;<i> out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * tuxfamily.org : This is currently my favourite... A very friendly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    hoster, I already have another project there (baller.tuxfamily.org)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    and made good experiences there so far.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Did you base your project on original baller sources?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have cleaned up Baller sources here:
</I>&gt;<i>    <A HREF="http://koti.mbnet.fi/tammat/hatari/sources/baller-src.tar.gz">http://koti.mbnet.fi/tammat/hatari/sources/baller-src.tar.gz</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I've ANSIfied the sources and fixed signedness&amp;  int size etc issues)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    Servers are located in Europe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    (==&gt;  fast for most Hatari developers), they offer Mercurial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    repositories, mailing lists and webspace. Only drawback: We would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    need to install our own bugtracker at the website, there are no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    pre-installed bugtracking services.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tuxfamily looks very good, but it seems to live on donations:
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="http://www.tuxfamily.org/en/support">http://www.tuxfamily.org/en/support</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I.e. it could get the same issue as BerliOS?
</I>
Hello

according to 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities</A> 
(assuming it's up to date) the only services that provide at least
  - mercurial
  - web hosting
  - mailing list
  - bug tracker

are alioth, sourceforge and tuxfamily.

Maybe gnu savannah too, but as it was said, they seem to have a strict 
licence requirement ; I'm not sure it would go with all the pieces we 
could have in Hatari in the future (I don't care about GPL over BSD 
licences, but I don't really like the idea to force the licence to GPL 
to be hosted there ; someone could contribute some free non gpl code to 
Hatari and it would be a problem)

I don't know alioth, neither tuxfamily and have no idea on their viability.

So maybe the safest bet would be to go back to sourceforge ; maybe they 
include some commercials, but if we look for safety and don't want to 
rely on donations-only hosting, this could be the best tradeoff. It 
would be annoying to move Hatari hosting every 2 years.

As Thomas said, we still have our account there, so importing stuffs 
should be possible without too much problems.

Or go to tuxfamily (they're french, so it's certainly a good solution :) 
) if you have a good experience with them ?


But what about the mailing list ? It would be nice to be able to import 
the berlios archive into sourceforge (or other) maiing list ; can it be 
done ?

Nicolas
