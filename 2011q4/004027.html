</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; As we are using mercurial, bitbucket seems like a viable option.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BitBucket seems a little bit too commercial for me - e.g. they only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> allow 5 users for the free repositories. That's not much.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; We can also use this as opportunity to move to git (which proved to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; be more popular than hg).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Anyhow, there is also google code, github, etc... Depends on the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; criteria for choosing.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'd say, the top requirements are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Source code repository with a proper VCS (IMHO I would not use
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; anything else beside Mercurial or git anymore).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Webspace for our Hatari website
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Enough space for storing our release-tarballs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Mailing list
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - Bugtracker (could be handled via webspace also)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Apart from these top requirements, there are some other nice-to-have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> features like forums, but since we hardly use them (and there are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alternatives like the Hatari forum on atari-forum.com instead), it's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> not so important to have them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So I think we can drop Google Code - since they do not provide webspace
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for project, do they?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; if we were to use the most popular revision tool, I guess we would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; use cvs or svn (if we only take into account the number of users /
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; projects using it).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Well, agreed, for the development style we use with Hatari, we could
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> also use a centralized VCS like SVN again, but IMHO the distributed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> VCSes are really really better, e.g. because they also allow offline
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> development etc.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CVS is really a pain, and in SVN I don't like the branch and tag
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handling, so I'd really say we stick with a distributed VCS instead ;-)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Couldn't agree more with all of above!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I personnaly prefer to stay with mercurial, I don't see any point in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; using git over mercurial for our own development (which honnestly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't really make use of mercurial features that much in fact, we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; never really created branches or things like that to support several
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Hatari versions at a time).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am using git a lot at work nowadays, and I have to say, it's really a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> very powerful and good tool. When we moved away from CVS a couple of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> years ago, there were some reasons to use mercurial instead:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - git is harder to learn, that still applies today, but now there are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; more people around who already know it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - there was hardly any git support for Windows users ... I think that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; has also changed a lot during the last years.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> So IMHO we could also switch to git nowadays, but we don't really need
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it for our development style, so we can also stick with Mercurial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> instead.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If somebody prefers Git, this plugin can be used as git / hg bridge:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are also scripts for Git:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; Let's see what hosting solutions we can find for mercurial, but I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; not sure sourceforge is the way to go (unless they really changed
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; their policy lately)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IIRC these were the main problems with SourceForge in the past:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - They disabled access to the raw CVS repository, you could only used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; checked-out versions of the files ==&gt; this does not apply anymore for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; distributed VCSes since you always get the full repository now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - They did not offer modern VCS at that point in time, SVN support just
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; started, but neither Mercurial or Git were available ==&gt; This has
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; changed completely
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - The servers became terribly slow, releasing a tarball was a pain
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; ==&gt; As far as I know, they use faster servers now
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - The website became very hard to use while they tried to renew the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; design and handling of the pages ==&gt; It's much better nowadays.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It still has lots of adverts. &#160;I think PCs and Browser have just gotten
</I>&gt;<i> much faster at loading &amp; showing them...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Most of the old pain points are vanished, so if we want to have an
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;easy&quot; solution (I mean, the old Hatari project is still registered
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there), we should consider going back to SourceForge.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ...but SF could be OK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Apart from SourceForge, I think these are good alternatives:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * www.nongnu.org : Uses pretty much the same web interface as berlios
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; since both are derived from earlier versions of SourceForge, so we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; might feel at home there quite fast. Major drawback: They are very,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; very picky about the GNU philosophie, e.g. we would first need to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; replace Linux by GNU/Linux everywhere in our code and documentation,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; and IIRC they prohibit that a program links against a non-free
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; library (which is not a problem for us yet, but we might need this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; one day for Pasti or one of the other disk image libraries).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe also:
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<A HREF="http://alioth.debian.org/">http://alioth.debian.org/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * github.com or gitorious.org ... we should also consider those if we
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; decide to move to git ... I think they are quite popular amongst git
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have some stuff at gitorious.org. &#160;It doesn't have a bug tracker
</I>&gt;<i> nor web page hosting (but you can have wiki pages) which rules it
</I>&gt;<i> out.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * tuxfamily.org : This is currently my favourite... A very friendly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; hoster, I already have another project there (baller.tuxfamily.org)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; and made good experiences there so far.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Did you base your project on original baller sources?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have cleaned up Baller sources here:
</I>&gt;<i> &#160;<A HREF="http://koti.mbnet.fi/tammat/hatari/sources/baller-src.tar.gz">http://koti.mbnet.fi/tammat/hatari/sources/baller-src.tar.gz</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I've ANSIfied the sources and fixed signedness &amp; int size etc issues)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; Servers are located in Europe
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; (==&gt; fast for most Hatari developers), they offer Mercurial
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; repositories, mailing lists and webspace. Only drawback: We would
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; need to install our own bugtracker at the website, there are no
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &#160; pre-installed bugtracking services.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Tuxfamily looks very good, but it seems to live on donations:
</I>&gt;<i> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<A HREF="http://www.tuxfamily.org/en/support">http://www.tuxfamily.org/en/support</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I.e. it could get the same issue as BerliOS?
</I>
The discussion has branched off :) One quick thing to mention is that
we can use more than one service. I agree it is not easy to maintain
but just to keep in mind, there are projects that use google code for
bug tracking, github/bitbucket for repo, etc...

A neat feature of git would be gerrit[1] but I don't think anyone
provides it for free at all.
