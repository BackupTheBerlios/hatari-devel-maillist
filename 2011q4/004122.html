<PRE>Hi Anders,

Thanks for the sound files. I believe the sound bugs can be worked out
with these files as it is easy to hear what is going on.

The patch you applied is activated, the difference in the bass might
be heard if patched an unpatched versions of Hatari are compared.
The bass should be positively affected by the dc/subsonic IIR filter
because the previous FIR method is suboptimal; the 512 taps can only
address a cutoff frequency of 44100/512 = 86 Hz; running average
filters have bad frequency domain properties; and, and the delay
on a FIR filter is 512/2 = 256 samples!; and this delayed DC blocking
is applied to the current sound!

The IIR filter provided is fast(er?), and the perfectly correct method.

I want perfect sound, this filter is just one step forward.

David

Hi!

Interesting work, is there something special one have to do to activate 
it after compile time? I applied the patch, it seemed to go ok:

ae$ patch &lt;../../sound.c.2011oct28c.diff
(Stripping trailing CRs from patch.)
patching file sound.c
QuadMBP:src ae$

Both linear and table mixing sounds just like the original Hatari 1.5 
here. Your previous patch from Aug 5 had much better audio on the Linear 
mixing mode.

Here are some comparisons of YM sample quality on Hatari 1.5, with your 
Aug 5 patch and a real machine.

<A HREF="http://ae.dhs.nu/tmp/sound/">http://ae.dhs.nu/tmp/sound/</A>

All normalized to 0 dB to have equal volume. I'd say your Aug 5 patch is 
by far the best we have yet :) Looking forward to see if your new patch 
from today is possible to activate.
