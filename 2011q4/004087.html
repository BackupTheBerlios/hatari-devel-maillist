<PRE>Hi,

Some news :

I've finished to merge the new core.

It compiles and link (but I've commented many lines of code for now)
(essentially in the cpu_cycle_exact functions for now)

The old core compiles and runs well

The new core compiles well.

When I run hatari, I get the following messages (falcon emu) :

M68000 Bus Error reading at address $ff8e09.
M68000 Bus Error reading at address $ff8e09.
M68000 Bus Error reading at address $ff8e09.

M68000 Bus Error reading at address $ff8e09.
M68000 Bus Error reading at address $ff8e09.
M68000 Bus Error reading at address $ff8e09.

...


I already had the M68000 Bus Error reading at address $ff8e09 error 
before my patching.
But I had it only once.

I had never seen the $10, $ 114 and $116 errors.
And bus error didn't loop like this at startup.

Does this ring you a bell or should I have a closer look at my changes ?

Regards

Laurent
