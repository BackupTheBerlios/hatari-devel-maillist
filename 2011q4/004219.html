</I>&gt;<i> Hello
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> thanks for your explanation, I applied your patch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For my information, what are the differences between the original filter
</I>&gt;<i> in the ST (with several R and C) and the one with your values and only
</I>&gt;<i> one R and C ? Does the ST's one filters different freqs ? (even if it
</I>&gt;<i> would be subtle to hear)
</I>
The lumped calculation of R and C is mathematically and electrically
equal to the individual values, thus, is the same.

The IIR filter 11Hz cutoff frequency is greater than the MEGA ST and
STFNR, but less than the ST/STFAR. This cutoff frequency is not that
critical unless it negatively impacts the audio passband.

The 100uF electrolytic capacitor works very well at low frequencies and
blocks DC more than adequately, but will attenuate higher frequencies
(thus the 1uF in parallel with 100uF on the ST [table on page 137] ).

The 16 bit 11Hz IIR filter works adequately at low frequencies (&lt; 30 Hz),
blocks DC more than adequately, does not attenuate higher frequencies,
and is an improvement over the FIR filter. I believe it is overkill
to improve the IIR filter's low frequency performance with int64_t or
floating point math (I think 11Hz is close to the best for 16 bits).

Comparing the IIR DC filter and ST DC filter at various frequencies:
DC - IIR DC filter (excellent)
DC - ST  DC filter (very good)
Subsonic below 11 Hz  - IIR DC filter (yes good)
Subsonic below 0.4 Hz - ST  DC filter (yes..but)
30 Hz - IIR DC filter (good -0.53 dB)
30 Hz - ST  DC filter (very good  0.0 dB)

Note that the ST has another dc blocking capacitor on the output, and
the STe has dc blocking in several places. Cascaded high-pass filters
effectively increases the corner frequency. These dc blocking filters
are needed in hardware, but not software because we are not emulating
dc offsets due to transistor bias networks (AC circuit analysis here).

*** Should be emulated ***
The Lowpass Filter formed by C10 = 0.1 uF and
(R8=1k//2k//R9=10k//R10=5.1k//47k) = 550.25 ohms
for a lowpass corner frequency of 1/(2*pi*(0.1*10e-6)*550.25) = 2892.4 Hz
(STFNR reference designators R8 R9 R10 C10)

Thanks for applying the dc filter patch, and thanks for the good info.

Referring to Figure 1 and the Table of Components in
st magazine - N023 - janvier 1988 - page136 et 137.jpg :

C1) Is 1uF non-electrolytic (see fig3 C14) on ST/STFAR,
- - 47uF electrolytic on the other computers.
- - This demonstrates that Atari would use less capacitance
- - when a Higher quality capacitor is used.
- - 
- - An electrolytic capacitor looks like:
- -          R      L        C
- -    o---\/\/---UUUU------||-------o
- -                     |        |
- -                      --\/\/--
- -                          R leakage
- -
- - RL in series with a Resistor in parallel with the
- - Capacitor.
- - This means that dc is not completely blocked and
- - high audio frequencies are attenuated by an electrolytic
- - capacitor as compared to a non-electrolytic capacitor.
- - Distortion can be caused by dielectric absorption.

C2) Is not emulated, but definitely affects the sound as a
- - 2900 Hz first order low pass filter.
- - Real YM digi-sound is probably mellower than Hatari's.
- -
- - I'm going to look into this.

C3) See C1 above. It looks like the ST has a 1uF in parallel
- - with the 100uF electrolytic, the ST/STFAR just uses 1uF,
- - and the rest use just 100uF.
- - The objective is to Not affect the audio pass-band. It
- - appears that any capacitance from 1uF to 100uF is OK as
- - long as the capacitor is up to the job.
- - The 1uF capacitor would have a highpass corner at 42Hz
- - (65 Hz on ST/STFAR because of different resistors).
- - 1uF looks a little Too small.

C5) See C1 above.

R1) 1K on Atari, 2.2K on ZX Spectrum. This accounts for some
- - difference in sound between the two computers.
- - A different volume table would make the difference here.

R2) 3K on ST/STFAR (because Vcc is 5volts?), the rest use 10K
- - (affects bass frequency response and bias slightly).
- - I don't believe that these resistor values really needed
- - to be changed to 3K and 8.2K
- - R2 and R3 set the bias voltage on the base of Q1.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Thanks
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; David
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; PS:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; My lousy mail frustrates me also. It would be a luxury to have a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; secure email connection with highlighting. I have to cut and paste
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; into vim. I think a solution is to save the email source, open it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with kmail, edit, then cut and paste into lousy telus mail.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not that I want to promote the obvious &quot;big&quot; ones, but maybe you should
</I>&gt;<i> give a try to gmail, yahoo or hotmail ? ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But if you use vim, I'm sure there should be a small vim script floating
</I>&gt;<i> around that indent the mail you want to answer by adding &quot;&gt; &quot; at the
</I>&gt;<i> start of each line and wrapping at 80 columns.
</I>
Cutting and pasting with kmail worked well. I'll look for a script
or write one now that I've been investigating this.

Thanks,
David
