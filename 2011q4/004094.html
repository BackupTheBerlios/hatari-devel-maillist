&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>

Hello

I don't think I will have time to work on cpu for 1.6 ; fdc code took 
quite a lot of time and I'd like to do a release with it and other 
improvements we could get before the end of the year (christmas gift or 
so :) )

Regarding merging the patches from uae-cpu into winuae cpu, I wonder if 
it could not create conflicts with getting a fully working falcon cpu 
with prefetch, caches and cycles.
Adding those patch could add complexity in winuae core and makes it 
harder to debug the winuae core in Hatari.

So far, we have a working core for STF/STE (68000 based) computers with 
uae-cpu ; winuae cpu already gives good result for Falcon mode. I agree 
it would be good to merge everything in one CPU, but I think it would be 
easier to merge both CPU when they all work &gt; 95 %.

For STF, it's already the case, but for Falcon some cpu cases are not OK 
yet. I think that winuae core should be working with almost all falcon 
demos/programs before merging 68000 patches in it.

 From the user point of view, we have a solution (even if it's at 
compile time) to make ST or Falcon work in the best mode.

I think efforts would be better used to improve falcon mode, because the 
user will really see the improvement in the next release. Merging today 
patch from uae-cpu into winuae will not be necessarily visible to the 
users immediatly, because if the winuae cpu is not 100 % working, they 
will not use it.

I don't say those patches should not be merged (even if some of them 
should be completly rewritten), but I have the feeling it's a little too 
early to do it.


Nicolas
