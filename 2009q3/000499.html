Ah yes, I remember now, that table declaring them static, effectively
giving them file scope. But uhm, is this overhead really noticeable?
It seems you know GCC a lot better than me, so I wont argue, I just
find it hard to maintain and it leads to all that code duplication. I
keep thinking that these things should be dynamically linked and then
the functors could be wrestled out from there... I am probably wrong
:<i>) What I actually know best, is M68k :D I like readable, manageable
</I>C-code tho :)


&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; How do you want to detect that SDL feature? Hard-coding it with #ifdefs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; is a bad idea, IMHO.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I guess there are several ways to do this, including the check for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hardware surfaces. The safest way should nevertheless be to do a bit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of profiling on buffer creation (that is, program start _and_ screen
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mode changes). You can do a wait for vsync, and see how much time will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pass in between. If its shorter than a given threshold, say 50Hz, then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you dont have any vsync...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like run-time detection, but isn't it possible to do it only on Hatari
</I>&gt;<i> startup, why it would need to be done on each screen mode change?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Some programs, especially for Falcon do frequent mode changes.)
</I>
Host screen mode changes, like say, going to full screen, could change
the whole situation. In OS X at least, where it seems you bypass
compositing by rendering SDL full screen...  And sure, in Behn i mess
with the VIDEL until it bleeds out the DSP port. Nearly anyway. Well,
I was young and naive ;)

&gt;&gt;<i> A similar test is already done to get fine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> granularity cycle timing (and the comments about OS X in that part of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the code are wrong mind you - we have HPET just as much as linux do).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On PowerPC? &#160;(I think Thomas' Mac is PowerPC :-))
</I>
Ah, havent a clue about PPC, but then the #ifdefs are wrong anyway -
and yes you are right - it is... :)
