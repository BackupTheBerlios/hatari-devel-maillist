Ok, talking to my guru gives the same answer: The C standard defines
that bss should be cleared. And Eero found the info that i could not
find, so I back down from this... Sorry for jumping the gun - again -
bad habit. I guess the fix was just too simple to be correct....

&gt;<i> So the real problem (a wrong memory access) might still persist, it's
</I>&gt;<i> just not visible anymore since the variable has been moved to another
</I>&gt;<i> location in memory.
</I>
I will try to track this down as best as I can tomorrow daytime.
Better get as much done as possible before holidays end....

&gt;&gt;<i> Once we know where your compiler puts the nFrameSkips variable in BSS,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I could check whether e.g. any of the variables before or after it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be written in a way that overwrites/corrupts nFrameSkips.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For that you don't need the &quot;gcc -S&quot; output, but rather an
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;objdump -Drx hatari&quot; of the whole executable (since the linker still
</I>&gt;<i> might re-arrange things).
</I>&gt;<i> K&#229;re, could you please create such an objdump of your executable to see
</I>&gt;<i> which variables are placed right before the nFrameSkips variable?
</I>
Agreed, but since I have been messing with x86 assembly (urgh) all
day, optimizing my converters by looking at GCC output (with at least
theoretically some good improvements), I may as well go the whole
round and see what actually moves, put some guards in there and so on.
I guess i also need to delve deeper into your Xcodeproj, which is
converted from a very old 2.x format to the current 3.1 standard -
maybe there are some nasty switches generated there.

And since my efforts to get off the night shift seem to work fine, I
am dead tired now, so it will happen tomorrow. Patches and all.

Good night/morning :)
