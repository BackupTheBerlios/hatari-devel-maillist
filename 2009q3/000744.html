<PRE>Hi,

On Thursday 24 September 2009, <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/hatari-devel">npomarede at corp.free.fr</A> wrote:
&gt;<i> looking at the png screenshot's code, I see a call to SDL_UnlockSurface
</I>&gt;<i> after processing each row, but I don't see the corresponding
</I>&gt;<i> SDL_LockSurface.
</I>
Thanks, fixed.


&gt;<i> Am I missing something or is this really an (harmless) error?
</I>
Doesn't seem to have done any harm, but according to SDL documentation
Un/LockSurface()  should be used.

It's possible that with current Hatari SDL surfaces locking isn't needed
(not HW surfaces) and that's why it's harmless.


&gt;<i> Why is a lock required for each row, would it be enough to
</I>&gt;<i> lock at start and  unlock when whole screen was saved as png ?
</I>
According to SDL documentation:
	<A HREF="http://www.libsdl.org/docs/html/sdllocksurface.html">http://www.libsdl.org/docs/html/sdllocksurface.html</A>

Locks should be released before doing any syscalls:
&quot;No operating system or library calls should be made between lock/unlock 
pairs, as critical system locks may be held during this time.&quot;

I would assume that libpng uses just write() which is safe even in
signal context (or fwrite() which isn't safe in signal context).


&gt;<i> Eero, any idea ? (I think you're the one who wrote png support)
</I>
You could ask on the SDL mailing list why Unlocking is needed for
syscalls.

Maybe it's important on Windows?  Or when using OpenGL?


	- Eero
