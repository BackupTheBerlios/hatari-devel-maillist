Well, it's hard to judge what method is the best. I'm not sure adding some 
special cases for playing sample is necessarily the way to go : a real ST 
doesn't do that, so an emulator should not need to do it either.

This is all quite subjective, unless the source code for Saint's sound is 
published, it's hard to compare Hatari and Saint sound on a more 
objective/theorical basis.

Some postprocessing could be added to Hatari to enhance/filter some 
frequencies and give a better emulation of the RC filter in a real ST, but 
this is likely to please some people and don't please others (look for 
'blep synthesis' in google, this seems to be one of the most accurate way 
to render sound, but quite CPU intensive).
