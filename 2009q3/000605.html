<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; That's great! I'll get back to you once I've tested the new engine 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; too. BTW, is there a reliable way to detect Hatari, so I can serve 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; different versions of the music depending on the emulator?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>
Salut Nicolas!

&gt;<i> no there's no such things, as hatari is supposed to be 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;undetectable&quot; from 
</I>&gt;<i> the running program, to ensure maximum compatibility and the closest 
</I>&gt;<i> emulation possible of a real Atari. This should &quot;force&quot; us to 
</I>&gt;<i> correct bug 
</I>&gt;<i> :)
</I>
That's the first time I've heard a really good reason not to enable
the virtual machine to detect the emulator. 8-)

&gt;<i> And serving different version of the music would not be a good idea, 
</I>&gt;<i> because if you music is &quot;tuned&quot; for Hatari because of a sound 
</I>&gt;<i> difference, 
</I>&gt;<i> then the day we'll fix Hatari then your music will sound bad again.
</I>
Well, the way Pacifist and STeem lets you detect the emulator, you
get a version number as well, so for version numbers I know of problems
with, I can just correct the problem, and for unknown (=future)
versions,
I could just pass control to the user.

&gt;<i> So, better warn the user that problems are known with 
</I>&gt;<i> Steem/Saint/Hatari/... or any emulator in general (or that it 
</I>&gt;<i> requires at 
</I>&gt;<i> least v1.3 of Hatari in the case the volume problem is gone 
</I>&gt;<i> is gone with 
</I>&gt;<i> this new release).
</I>
Ideally, I would prefer if a user with a real machine wouldn't have
to be bothered AT ALL, and let emulator users have to make choices (if
I can't detect them in code). It makes sense to reward those who take
the effort to run my demos on a real machine. 8-)

&gt;<i> By the way, do you use the LMC chip to change DMA sample 
</I>&gt;<i> volumes/filter/..., or do you play sample with the default hardware 
</I>&gt;<i> settings ? Because LMC is clearly not fully implemented for now.
</I>
Very good question. But no, I don't touch the LMC at all, and as far
as I know, maxYMiser doesn't either, unless my song specifically
tells it to. Which mine doesn't. 8-)


Per.
