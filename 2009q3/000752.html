 Hi Laurent,

sorry for the late reply, I'm quite busy with real life work atm...
(and as it currently looks like, this won't change in the upcoming
weeks...)

You mean one for playing (memory to crossbar) and one for recording
(crossbar to memory), don't you?

&gt;<i> My first problem was to understand which parameters are for each DMA,

</I>&gt;<i> (In page B-28 of the compendium, you can read : (DMA OUT) is linked

</I>
Well, I guess DMA OUT = DMA playing and DMA IN = DMA recording ?

&gt;<i> For the DAC part :

</I>&gt;<i> Thomas, Would you please have a look at Crossbar_GenerateSamples() ?
</I>&gt;<i> Can I use it the same as you did in DmaSound.c ?

</I>
Sorry, I lost a little bit track about all your other mails... Do your
problem still persist here, or is this fixed already?

I saw that you're using a DACBUFFER_SIZE of MIXBUFFER_SIZE*2*64*2 Bytes
there, ... but that's a buffer of 4 Megabytes! Isn't that a little bit
too much for a sound buffer? It doesn't sound right to me to use such
big buffers for sound...

 Thomas
