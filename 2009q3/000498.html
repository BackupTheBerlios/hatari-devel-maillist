<PRE>Hi,

As the functions are declared static, they're in practice the same and you
can consider them as inline.  With GCC, specifying &quot;inline&quot; is pretty much
redundant; if a function is static, with optimizations enabled GCC either
inlines or directly jumps to it (depending on in how many places it's
called in the code).  You cannot help noticing this when you debug GCC
optimized code with Gdb... :-)

If you would put them to separate object files, they would need to be global
functions and would have the normal function call overhead.  If I remember
correctly, a more important reason was that then the helper functions in
screen.c (which are called from the convertors) would then need to be global
and have the normal function call overhead too.

(GCC / GAS don't support (yet) inter-object optimizations.)

</I>
I like run-time detection, but isn't it possible to do it only on Hatari
startup, why it would need to be done on each screen mode change?

(Some programs, especially for Falcon do frequent mode changes.)

On PowerPC?  (I think Thomas' Mac is PowerPC :-))
