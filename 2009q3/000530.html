<PRE>Hi,

On my part AFAIK no, unless you come up with some other issues with
the new debugger stuff. :-)

The smarter screen resolution selection I've been thinking about and K&#229;re's
screen conversion routines + overlay code simplification are better done
after the release I think, at least if the release comes within couple of
weeks.


JB, you started checking blitter stuff, was there something that should or
could be fixed for the release?

</I>

Regarding documentation which I've been going through lately...

The manual and compatibility list should be pretty well up to date, except
for those few ST / STe programs that are marked as not fully working for
Hatari version (before) 1.0:
- F15 Strike Eagle 2: &quot;Keyboard emulation seems to be dodgy&quot;
- Slayer: &quot;Raster fx at highscore entry dodgy&quot;
- Neochrome: &quot;Rasters sometimes unstable&quot;
- Protracker STE: &quot;50KHz replay duff&quot;
Could somebody check them?

(As the Falcon stuff is now mostly working, I'll change their &quot;Working&quot;
column to &quot;Hatari version&quot; and its &quot;-&quot;/&quot;partially&quot;/&quot;yes&quot; entries for
to &quot;v1.3&quot; + suitable colors, like is done for the other compatibility
tables.)


Nicolas, could you put something about the video.c rewrite to the release
notes too?

Thomas, I think the DSP section in the todo.txt needs an update too.

The screenshots page on www-page could be updated as discussed earlier...
