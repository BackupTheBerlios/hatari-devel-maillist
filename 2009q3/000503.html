Yes sure, but still.... It can be done better. So why not do that then? :)

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I also don't think that this problem is related to CPU caches -
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; since it does not occur on Linux or Windows with modern CPUs! The
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; problem must have something to do with Mac OS X exclusively.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That is not what I have been saying at all. What I am saying is, this
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> new code fits better - that is all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And all I am trying to do is to squash false rumors like &quot;Hatari does

</I>&gt;<i> people read this thread. Believe me, it's often quite hard to get rid
</I>&gt;<i> of such reputations, there were similar things in the past...
</I>
Hatari works quite right on modern CPUs. Because they are hellishly
fast anyway :) And still, we can make it even better...

&gt;<i> Ok, so we agree that the performance problems on Mac OS X are likely
</I>&gt;<i> not caused by modern CPU caches, so let's stop this topic and focus on
</I>&gt;<i> the real culprit (maybe Eero's LED fix already helps?).
</I>

Indeed! Things are already looking up, I just compiled a new version
from Hg that seems to fly here! Mono troubles are still there tho, but
I am confident we can weed that out fairly quick now... This is pri 1
for me at the moment.

&gt;&gt;<i> Again, this is the case, like I have tried to explain before: SDL on
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> OS X is crap due to compositing. But helping it suck a bit less when
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> it does not hurt the other platforms cant be a bad thing, can it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, but how do you help the SDL with your new code? Yes, I know, it
</I>&gt;<i> fits better in your cache, but that does not affect the SDL, does it?
</I>&gt;<i> I mean, if the bottleneck is the SDL screen update, why do you affect
</I>&gt;<i> it with your code that does not call any SDL function at all? That's
</I>&gt;<i> why I asked you to do some additional tests recently...
</I>
Well, not doing the conversion back and forth to 8-bit certainly helps
:<i>) The rest (vsync, memcmp() etc) is still to come...
</I>
&gt;<i> By the way, do you also have these performance problems in fullscreen
</I>&gt;<i> mode?
</I>
Nope. Except for the new Monochrome problem, which is still there.
Like said, fullscreen SDL bypasses compositing. Or so i read
somewhere...

&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * On platforms where SDL updates don't incur Vsync, the screen
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; updates could be done so that screen-blitting is skipped for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; lines that haven't changed.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; How do you want to detect that SDL feature? Hard-coding it with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; #ifdefs is a bad idea, IMHO.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I guess there are several ways to do this, including the check for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hardware surfaces. The safest way should nevertheless be to do a bit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of profiling on buffer creation (that is, program start _and_ screen
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mode changes). You can do a wait for vsync, and see how much time will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> pass in between. If its shorter than a given threshold, say 50Hz, then
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you dont have any vsync...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, but that might render the code more complex again, not sure if this
</I>&gt;<i> fits your goal to make it easier... ;-)
</I>
There are always tradeoffs...

&gt;&gt;<i> A similar test is already done to get fine
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> granularity cycle timing (and the comments about OS X in that part of
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the code are wrong mind you - we have HPET just as much as linux do).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know about HPET in general, but SDL_Delay at least has a
</I>&gt;<i> granularity of 10 ms on Mac OS X. (Though it might have changed with
</I>&gt;<i> recent versions of Mac OS X and the SDL... when I wrote that code, this
</I>&gt;<i> was still Mac OS X 10.2 or 10.3).
</I>
I think HPET arrived in 10.3, but that does not really matter - its there now :)

/K&#229;re - running a much faster Hatari this time around - On OS X - On
Modern Hardware(tm) :D
