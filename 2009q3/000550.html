<PRE>Hi,

On Tuesday 04 August 2009, <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/hatari-devel">npomarede at corp.free.fr</A> wrote:
&gt;<i> &gt; What would be utterly perfect (and is already available in STEem debug

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be able to set new breakpoints relative to the current one - in bytes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from PC _or_ in cycles/NOPs from PC....
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This would make debugging synclock code a dream...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> in a previous mail eero talked about having some accessor functions ; one

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This way, we would have HBL and LineCycle variables in the debugger and

</I>&gt;<i> As for setting relative breakpoints in cycles that would mean to be able

</I>&gt;<i> then you could do the math youself to add the desired cycles to this
</I>&gt;<i> value and set a breakpoint where FrameCycles=your_value.

Hm.  This shouldn't be too hard to add.  I need to:
* change &quot;regsize&quot; to &quot;valuetype&quot;
* define types for numbers, different registers &amp; variables and functions
* add function pointer to value union
* in breakpoint checking check for function type (+call that function)
* have a helper for checking whether valuetype is register because that's
  currently done in some places in the parser
* add the accessor functions for things you mentioned
* parse the names for them &amp; fill valuetype etc properly

I can do this at the end of the week along with the number base option
stuff.


&gt;<i> I think that when we enter debug mode on a breakpoint (or maybe also when
</I>&gt;<i> pressing pause), it could be useful to display nVBLs, *pFrameCycles,
</I>&gt;<i> *pHbl and *pLineCycle by calling Video_GetPosition. This way, you know at
</I>&gt;<i> what screen position your breakpoint triggered, which is very useful when
</I>&gt;<i> you want to debug overscan or other video-sync related code.
</I>
Btw. I forgot to mention that now &quot;b help&quot; will both list the supported
Hatari variables and show their currently values:
--------------------
&gt;<i> b help
</I>...
  Valid Hatari variable names (and their current values) are:
  - HBL (0)
  - VBL (67)
--------------------

You can use that after the breakpoint is hit.

It could list &amp; show the accessor function variable values too.


&gt;<i> Other variables that could be used for breakpoints : track/sector nbr as
</I>&gt;<i> used in fdc.c Could be useful to debug some disk related issue, but
</I>&gt;<i> unless someone really say he require them now, I'm not sure it's urgent
</I>&gt;<i> to do (most remaining fdc problems are related to commands timing, so
</I>&gt;<i> unless pasti is ported to hatari, brekpoints won't really help on these
</I>&gt;<i> cases).
