Sorry, but if you're talking about recent CPUs with 2 MB cache or even
more, this is not as valid as it might be for older CPUs (where the
old code seems to be faster anyway): The screen buffers which are used
by the old code take about 800 kB and should fit into a 2 MB cache as
well!

I also don't think that this problem is related to CPU caches - since
it does not occur on Linux or Windows with modern CPUs! The problem
must have something to do with Mac OS X exclusively.

&gt;<i> I haven't found these extra GCC options to help much, at least if you
</I>&gt;<i> apply them to whole Hatari (for example although --funroll-loops
</I>&gt;<i> helps sometimes, generally it just slows down things as it makes code
</I>&gt;<i> larger so that it doesn't fit as well to cache).
</I>
That's also too system specific. We shouldn't include such specifc
optimization flags into the default Makefile.

&gt;<i> &gt; (Point being, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; most demos and games, like i have already stressed, most of the time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't leave the frame buffer alone from frame to frame).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that many games and demos don't write to the whole (overscan)
</I>&gt;<i> screen. Or they can update screen only every other frame.  Game menus
</I>&gt;<i> can also be static or only partly animated.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So the comparison might still be faster with many/most demos &amp; games.
</I>&gt;<i> And it preloads the line contents to CPU cache for conversion. :)
</I>
Right. And I still can't think of a really good reason why code should
suddenly execute slower on newer CPUs. I _really_ don't think this
problem has something to do with CPU caches. It must be a problem with
SDL on Mac OS X or something similar.

&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; * On platforms where SDL updates don't incur Vsync, the screen
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; updates could be done so that screen-blitting is skipped for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; lines that haven't changed.
</I>
How do you want to detect that SDL feature? Hard-coding it with #ifdefs
is a bad idea, IMHO.


Another question, K&#229;re, did you already had some spare time to do the
tests that I asked you to do? (Testing Spec512 screens etc.)

 Regards,
  Thomas
