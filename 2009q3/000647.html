Btw. I just noticed that you've discussed on the Hatari forum pages
(this was the first time I read them :-)):

Adding a frame around the Hatari window and getting notifications about
Hatari window sizes, on Windows.


Support for this has been a long time in Hatari, but currently it works only
for the X window system.

To have the same support for Windows would require implementing
some of the src/control.c file functionality also for Windows:
- Remote control socket support
  - Unix implementation is inside the HAVE_UNIX_DOMAIN_SOCKETS ifdef,
    I assume Windows (WinSock?) implementation would be similar
  - You could of course use also some other interprocess communcation
    mechanism on Windows if that works there better than sockets
- Embedding Hatari window inside parent window given in PARENT_WIN_ID
  environment variable (see Control_ReparentWindow() function)
   - libSDL code can be looked for an example on how to do this on Windows.
     The SDL functionality for this cannot be used by Hatari because
     that also disables all user input processing, but you can copy
     the relevant part of the code to Hatari and leave input disabling out.

Then, if you give Hatari a control socket name, you can then request Hatari
to automatically inform your program about the window size changes through
that socket[1].

The remote control socket allows changing at run-time most Hatari options 
that one can specify on the command line or doing actions one can do
from the internal Hatari settings dialog.  It also allows synthetizing user
input.

The current Hatari window embedding code will automatically handle
fullscreen on/off right i.e. disable embedding when going to fullscreen and
re-embedding the Hatari window when leaving fullscreen.

[1] I found out that Gtk window embedding couldn't be gotten to
automatically adapt to Hatari window size changes properly, so the size
changes are done explicitly in the Python Hatari UI when receiving these
messages.
