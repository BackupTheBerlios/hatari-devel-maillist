<PRE>Hi,

Do you think that some of the examples in to the current documentation
should be copied also to the new &quot;Usage examples&quot; section, or is it
enough to have there that isn't mentioned elsewhere?

From previously mentioned list these are already covered:
* stopping on program startup
* disassembling from PC
* Setting a simple PC breakpoint that triggers after 'n' times

Which leaves these:
* Setting breakpoint where register has a specific values
* Setting breakpoint where memory B/W/L has a specific values
  (with memory being a RAM location or an IO location,
   detect freq change in ff820a for example)
* Setting breakpoint on a specific screen position using 
  VBL/HBL/linecycle counter
* Single stepping
  - with e.g. regs shown after each step
* Listing stack contents
   - that being shown whenever one enters the debugger
* Setting breakpoint on register value change
  - so that instructions leading to it are show
    when the breakpoint is hit
  - without stopping
* Tracing all OS calls between two breakpoints
* Finding in which instruction addresses machine spends
  most of its time if program is e.g. stuck


&gt;<i> To me, there was only one unclear part and that's something I'd call
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;modifiers &amp; operators&quot;. I'm really confused by all that &quot;:trace&quot; and
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;:file&quot; and &quot;!&quot; etc syntax, it's only mentioned in its usage, I'd welcome
</I>&gt;<i> some complete list where these &quot;suffixes&quot; can be used, what are all
</I>&gt;<i> options etc... same for operators in general, again there were some
</I>&gt;<i> usage examples but not a complete reference.
</I>
Thanks for the review!  Now that I read it again, that part indeed is too
terse and doesn't necessarily proceed in the most logical order.

I did a fairly large update (new Breakpoint options section etc),
are those now explained better / good enough:
<A HREF="http://hg.berlios.de/repos/hatari/raw-file/tip/doc/manual.html#Breakpoints">http://hg.berlios.de/repos/hatari/raw-file/tip/doc/manual.html#Breakpoints</A>
?

PS. Note that debugger help &quot;help b&quot; and breakpoint help &quot;b help&quot; commands
give different help, former explains the breakpoint command and its options
while latter concentrates on the breakpoint condition syntax.
