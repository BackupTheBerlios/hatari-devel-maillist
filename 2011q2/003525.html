<PRE>Le 02/06/2011 20:27, Eero Tamminen a &#233;crit :

&gt;<i> Steem debugger's features which are missing from the current
</I>&gt;<i> Hatari CLI debugger:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Things that would seem to be straightforward to add:
</I>&gt;<i>    - History.  I would need to add tracking also instruction cycles
</I>&gt;<i>      to the code I posted earlier
</I>&gt;<i>      (= Steem History view&amp;  Trace info)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Showing values both in different lengts and numeric bases.
</I>&gt;<i>      In Hatari one gets latter with &quot;evaluate&quot; command, e.g. &quot;e a0&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i>      but that doesn't show the value if it were long/word/byte
</I>&gt;<i>    - All register values being shown with above info
</I>&gt;<i>      (= Steem Register monitor)
</I>&gt;<i>    - info commands for PSG, MFP, FDC and IKBD register values
</I>&gt;<i>      (= Steem monitors for these)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Info command for &quot;timings&quot; i.e. cycles since HBL/VBL, timer values,
</I>&gt;<i>      video address&amp;  scanline
</I>&gt;<i>      (= Steem Timings view)
</I>&gt;<i>    - memory dump in text format
</I>&gt;<i>      (= Steem Text monitor)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Text string and binary values (hex) search
</I>&gt;<i>      (= widgets in Steem monitor windows)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Disasm format options being changable at run-time
</I>&gt;<i>      (= Steem options)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Run for N cycles
</I>&gt;<i>      (Hatari continue command accepts only instructions, not cycles)
</I>
regarding the reg/timer/monitors/dump view, it's of course possible do 
use the &quot;info&quot; command already available and add more output to it.


&gt;<i> * These would be harder, either because I'm not sure where/how these
</I>&gt;<i>    would be best integrated or because they're more work:
</I>&gt;<i>    - Monitoring reads&amp;  writes to specific address.  Hatari supports only
</I>&gt;<i>      monitoring changes to values, not having breakpoints of reading values
</I>&gt;<i>      or writing the same value
</I>
Not supported in current Hatari and quite time consuming, because it 
requires evaluating &quot;memory access&quot; breakpoints on each read/write to 
memory.
I have a modified version that does this for my own debugging need, it 
could be possible to add some proper hooks in the corresponding memory 
handling functions, but we would also need to add a #define to enable 
this kind of memory breakpoint at compile time, because it can really 
slow down performance and not everybody needs it.

Still, this is the most useful we miss in my opinion, it's really 
powerful to monitor some memory location and I sometime use Steem just 
to see what part of a program accessed such memory region.

&gt;<i>    - Break on exceptions 2-8 vs. bombs vs. don't break.
</I>&gt;<i>      Hatari has only an option to break on address&amp;  bus errors
</I>&gt;<i>      &amp;  uninitialized exception handler.
</I>
Not sure this is important. In games/demos, you most likely want &quot;don't 
break&quot; because it often part of the protection to do such behaviour.

&gt;<i>    - Showing breakpoints in instruction dumps.  Hatari breakpoints
</I>&gt;<i>      are more advanced than the trivial address breakpoints...
</I>
We can show only PC breakpoint in that case, but it's sure Hatari syntax 
is more advanced than Steem's ont.

&gt;<i>    - Adding new symbol names for arbitrary addresses one at the time.
</I>&gt;<i>      Hatari debugger currently requires new symbols to be added to
</I>&gt;<i>      a file containing all the symbols + reloading that file
</I>
Can't say, I don't use that.

&gt;<i>    - Memory dump that shows also disassembly and values in different bases
</I>&gt;<i>      (= Steem Memory monitor)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Stack content display
</I>
Should be in the &quot;easy&quot; section I think, it's just a dump of the memory 
before the value pointed by A7.

&gt;<i>    - Shift Atari screen contents by 0/2/4/6 bytes
</I>
Not very useful, only use is when trying to debug overscan's emulation 
problems, but Hatari is now fairly robust.

&gt;<i> (I think rest of the Steem features can be supported by the Hatari
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoints.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do any of the above listed items (especially the easy ones) sound
</I>&gt;<i> interesting to be had in the CLI debugger?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (As I'm already listing missing Monst features as potential TODOs
</I>&gt;<i>   for Hatari debugger, I'll add these also to the todo.txt file.)
</I>
The info command for the different components can be useful, but it's of 
course more easy to use if you are in UI mode.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As to the Steem UI on top of these features, Steem's UI really has a *huge*
</I>&gt;<i> amount of functionality integrated to it.  With Hatari it would also need
</I>&gt;<i> to work for CPU&amp;  DSP as Hatari supports both.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So... I think you need to specify quite in detail what you would like to
</I>&gt;<i> have in the debugger GUI and in which priority order before it makes much
</I>&gt;<i> sense to start coding it.
</I>
Well the ability to open as many dump/info windows as wanted 
(hex/asm/mfp/video/sound/...) and have those content refreshed each time 
a breakpoint is encountered would be nice.

A stop/run button, as well as a &quot;execute only instruction&quot; buttons would 
be cool.

The possibility to click to define simple PC breakpoint (or monitor 
memory on B/W/L accesses)

And a way to search for hexa/text in Hatari's RAM.

At least, that what I use the most ; other people might have different 
needs.

&gt;<i> Hm.  Switching Hatari itself from SDL-only to Qt+SDL would be quite large
</I>&gt;<i> change.  Before considering that, I'd like to see for a bit longer how well
</I>&gt;<i> Nokia manages Qt...
</I>
By doing a quick search for QT + SDL, it appears it's quite easy to 
embed an SDL program in a QT ones (need to pass to SDL the window's id 
provided by QT)

Regarding what nokia will do with QT, even if development stopped 
definitly today, QT 4.7 is powerful enough to fill all our needs.


&gt;&gt;<i> Having external windows seems really much more useful to me : you keep
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the Atari's video screen untouched and you have a bunch of windows
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> locked on registers/asm/hex dump. You're not limited to Hatari's
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> resolution, but you can benefit of all the space your OS is giving you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (if you have dual monitor for example).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, then it really needs a real, modern widget toolkit.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In that case I think it's better to do the UI separately from Hatari
</I>&gt;<i> and utilize the remote API.  Only if the remote UI turns out infeasible,
</I>&gt;<i> I would go for integrating everything to Hatari binary itself.
</I>
I wonder if this could be an opportunity to &quot;clean&quot; Hatari and do a 
proper abstraction between the hardware emulation (which in the end 
mostly provides one video frame and one sound frame per vbl) and the 
emulator (which is reponsible for displaying video result and sending 
sound data to the audio system used by the OS).

The remote API implies to develop a lot of protocol to exchange data 
between the emulation and the emulator's UI ; I'm not really a big fan 
of this client-server mode when both parts are running on the same computer.

I think that what has beed made with SDL can be abstracted in a 
&quot;modularized&quot; way to allow other toolkits to access the emulation's data 
(registers, IO, ram, cpu, dsp, configuration, ...).

This would require some work to refactor some code in Hatari, but then 
it would benefit us for the emulation-emulator's UI integration in the 
same program, which would save some time on working on a remote API.

At least, openmsx and vice went this way, and they succeeded in doing 
it. I think it's the best choice performance-wise.
