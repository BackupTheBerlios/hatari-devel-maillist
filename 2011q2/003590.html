<PRE>Hi,

That won't work.

Breakpoints support only numbers, variables (like register names), indirect
addressing of them and a width (like &quot;(a1).w&quot;) + mask (like &quot;&amp; %11&quot;) for
that.  And having multiple of them with conditions between these.

Breakpoints don't support *run-time* evaluated arithemetic operations such
as addition i.e. parsing arbitrary arithmetic operations and storing
that parsetree[1] for run-time usage.

So, it needs to be:
	b VBL = {VBL+4}


&gt;<i> I don't think there's a big need for breakpoints with parts of the 
</I>&gt;<i> condition not being run-time evaluated (ie at the time the command is 
</I>&gt;<i> parsed).
</I>
Hatari debugger already has parse-time arithmetic expression evaluation
for _all_ debugger commands.  All expressions in given command that are
enclosed in &quot;&quot;/{} are evaluated before _any_ other debugger command
parsing (splitting args etc) is done.  It's separate code from
breakpoints and doesn't support conditionals[2] (and currently all
its indirect accesses are long-accesses).

[1]
There isn't any _run-time_ evaluation of arithmetic expressions for
conditional breakpoints, which is only place where such would (currently)
be useful, as evaluating strings (like evaluate.c does) would be too slow.
Because of how breakcond.c works[3] and for performance reasons,
it would require:
- pre-parsing of the expression and
- evaluating at run-time just the resulting parsetree
which would IMHO complicate the already hairy breakcond.c code too much.


With new PC based breakpoints, the expression evaluation performance
wouldn't anymore be an issue as they don't need to be evaluated on every 
instruction.  So, they could just store the user given expression as
string and evaluate that with the current arithmetic expression engine
at run-time.

[2]
However, if you want there to be also (potentially multiple) conditionals
for these, it means that PC breakpoints need conditional breakpoint engine
(breakcond.c) instead of the arithmetic expression evaluation engine
(evaluate.c).

And if you want conditional breakpoints to have a possibility for run-time
evaluated arithmetic expressions, you need a delimeter for that which is
separate from the delimer that indicates parser-time arithmetic
expression, and code to include such expression strings to parsed
conditions.


[3] Technical background:

There are some functionality overlaps with these two evaluation engines
(both accept variables/registers/symbols), but internally they work very
differently.

Breakcond.c has two clearly separate phases, one that parses the expression
completely to an internal representation and another which evaluates
the parsed binary result; whereas evaluate.c treats the expression as
stream, it's evaluated while it's parsed according to the operator 
precedence.

Half of the evaluate.c code is for parsing numbers in different bases
&amp; formats and these functions are used also by breakcond.c.  Rest of
evaluate.c then handles arithmetic operations, their precedence
and indirect addressing.


&gt;<i> But maybe we could have a syntax that allows both run time and parse
</I>&gt;<i> time value breakpoints ; what about saying that :
</I>&gt;<i>   - a register/internal variable is always run time evaluated when
</I>&gt;<i> provided directly with its name
</I>&gt;<i>   - when the reg/variable is enclosed in {} then the current value of
</I>&gt;<i> the reg/variable is substituted at parse time.
</I>
That's already supported with the conditional breakpoint and arithmetic
expression evaluation combination.  Latter has currently the '&quot;' delimeter,
and we're discussing changing that delimeter to {} and adding separate
delimeter for run-time evaluated _arithmetic_ expressions.


&gt;<i> So, if D0=12
</I>&gt;<i> b D0=40  will break when D0 reach 40
</I>&gt;<i> b {D0}=40 will break when 12=40 (ie never)
</I>
These are already supported (with &quot;&quot; being used instead of {}).

Even something like this works:
	b d0 &amp; &quot;2*(symbol)&quot; = &quot;VBL+4&quot;

(Mask d0 at run-time by doubled current value at address &quot;symbol1&quot;
and compare it to current VBL value + 4.)


&gt;<i> b VBL={VBL}+4  will break after 4 VBLs
</I>&gt;<i> b VBL=VBL+4  will never break because the same variable can't have 2
</I>&gt;<i> different values
</I>
But arithmetic operations aren't be supported by conditional breakpoint
parser and neither are (single or multiple) conditions by arithmetic
expression parser.  I think it would be possible to add support for
run-time evaluated arithmetic expressions to conditional breakpoints
if there's a separate syntax for indicating them, like [].

So, think carefully whether in addition to parse-time arithmetic
evaluation, you want with PC breakpoints:
1. run-time evaluated arithmetic expressions, or
2. run-time evaluated conditions, or
3. both...
:<i>-)
</I>
1) would be easiest to do and similar to MonST.

2) might be enough for most cases, but need significantly more work.

3) would need even more work and the code &amp; syntax would be more complex:
	b [data+2] = {a1-2}
