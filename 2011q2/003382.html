I don't think the copy operation should set a policy on it, that's up to
the caller.  Caller can igore the return value (as I didn't add a GCC
attribute that would give warning if it isn't).

 
&gt;<i> I think it would be better to always return true and don't set return
</I>&gt;<i> code to HD_STATUS_ERROR in hdc.c  (this would need to be tested on real
</I>&gt;<i> hardware, but I don't recall I already saw cases where dma failed
</I>&gt;<i> because of the dest address).
</I>
In the HDC case it's more of a HD command failing to do what was requested
than DMA failure.  I didn't check the hdc.c code to see whether it's
actually propagated to the Atari side though.

I would appreciate somebody with more knowledge about the HD side commenting 
on this...  Thomas?  Uwe?


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This way, we would have a common function to correctly copy data from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; disk images to the emulated RAM or IO space.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Half of the potentially unsafe operations are fread()s&amp;  fwrite()s to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; STRam, not just memcpy()s...  See e.g. gemdos.c which I've fixed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; earlier or the new hdc.c changes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, to be correct we would need some similar checks to ensure we wrap
</I>&gt;<i> to the start of the RAM once we reach the end of the RAM when
</I>&gt;<i> reading/writing.
</I>
Those do have checks, but no wrapping.


&gt;<i> Unless we encounter bugs due to this, I'm not sure this is a top
</I>&gt;<i> priority to handle this case.
</I>
I don't know any case e.g. for gemdos emulation where it would be something
that would need to be emulated instead of just a bug in the emulated program
which Hatari must guard against to be robust.


&gt;<i> &gt; stMemory_SafeCopy() copies only bytes that above states to be valid, it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ignores bytes going to invalid addresses. (As I don't see what it e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should do to bytes between STRamEnd and 0xe00000.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree for byte between end of ram and IO space, but you should take
</I>&gt;<i> into account the fact that the RAM is &quot;mirrored&quot; when you only have 0.5
</I>&gt;<i> MB or 1 MB out of 4 MB.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think the function should &quot;wrap&quot; when addr &gt; STRamEnd, not just ignore
</I>&gt;<i> the write.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, on a 512 KB ST, if DMA writes $1000 bytes to addr $7ff00,
</I>&gt;<i> it will reach up to $81f00, which in fact becomes addresses 0 to $1f00.
</I>&gt;<i> So in the end, the DMA really write to $7ff00-$7ffff and to 0-$1eff
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If addr &lt; 4 MB, addr should become addr % CURRENT_RAM_SIZE ; above 4 MB,
</I>&gt;<i> write should be ignored (this might be different on ST (TT ? Falcon ?
</I>&gt;<i> Mega ST ?) with up to 16 MB of RAM)
</I>
Feel free to improve the SafeCopy function. :-)

 
&gt;<i> Well, anyway I'm not sure any program is relying on this to willingly
</I>&gt;<i> write data with DMA on a boundary of the RAM.
</I>&gt;<i> At least stMemory_SafeCopy will prevent crash in Hatari itself which is
</I>&gt;<i> already a good thing.
</I>
Yes, that and logging that the emulated program has an issue are the main
things.
