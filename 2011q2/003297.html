<PRE>Hi,

After hearing that window isn't resizing by itself, maintly just:
- stuffing all the options to dialogs so that the dialogs still fit into
  Hatari window and users can understand the options in them
- Hatari doing something reasonable when the options user selected
  result in something that doesn't fit to available screen resolutions[1]
- Supporting --desktop option properly also with ST/STE too

I.e. doing better than what Hatari currently does without complicating
it too much for users or in code. :-)


[1] This is mainly an issue for things that support max res of say 800x480,
     but IMHO it's good to support such things.  Even higher end smartphones
    are now fast enough to run Hatari (without DSP emulation) mostly OKish,
    but they don't have high enough resolutions for full borders.  Neither
    do all netbooks.


&gt;<i> Selecting borders separatly will
</I>&gt;<i> also yield to a total width and height, so we can apply the same code we
</I>&gt;<i> have today.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In all the case, I intend to have an internal screen of approx 460x276 ;
</I>&gt;<i> if the SDL screen is bigger that that, we add extra black pixels
</I>
So, if users selects positive border sizes, it would be nice if you could
internally do the viewable area &quot;selection&quot;:
- as an offset _inside_ from the 460x276 area  border
- pad the screen with black if Hatari window resolution is larger
  than 460x276 so that the window contents get centered

This way all the options can be applied as user set them and just the result
clipped to the available desktop size/resolutions (or user selected max
size).


&gt;<i> I don't have much time to look at the options window layout I would need
</I>&gt;<i> for now, if you want to commit your falcon changes, go for it, we can
</I>&gt;<i> add other options later (I still need to write the code first :) )
</I>
I commited the new Screen dialog with &quot;keep resolution&quot; and &quot;disk led&quot;
options that were earlier missing from it.  + corresponding doc update.
