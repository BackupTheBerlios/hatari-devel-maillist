<PRE>Hi,

Well, it could mention that one just needs to prefix the CPU commands
with &quot;d&quot; (or &quot;dsp&quot; if using full command names) to do the exactly
same operations on DSP.

</I>
Yes:
	d &quot;pc&quot;
	dd &quot;pc&quot;

PC is a variable, but to &quot;evaluate&quot; its value, you need to
put it inside &quot;&quot;.

Quotes evaluate expressions and expressions can contain any arithmetic
operations, registers, breakpoint variables or loaded symbol names.
For example:
	d &quot;pc + d0 + (a0) * ($200) - (a1) &amp; %101 - 1&quot;
	d &quot;text&quot;

See &quot;help evaluate&quot; (or &quot;h e&quot;) for more info.


The reason why evaluating needs &quot;&quot;, is that otherwise parser
cannot differentiate what's a range and what's a subtraction
operation.

I.e. if expressions weren't quoted, you couldn't give a range
to disassemble as e.g:
	d $100-$120
would complain about invalid disassembly address $ffffffe0
(as these are unsigned values, -$20 wraps around).


Currently only command where expression doesn't need quoting is
address breakpoint (&quot;a&quot;).

Same can be done for any command that either:
- takes only a single input value and never more, or
- all other input to the command is separated by some character
  that cannot be used in the expressions.

In case of &quot;a&quot; command, the options are separated with ':' character
which isn't used by expressions.

However, currently there aren't any other such commands,
besides &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot; (continue), but for &quot;c&quot; I didn't think
non-quoted expression evalution to be necessary. :-)


One possibility would be separate range values with some other character
like ':' instead of '-':
	d $100:$200

Then you could instead of:
	d &quot;pc&quot;-&quot;pc+$20&quot;
use:
	d pc:pc+$20
	d pc

Same for the &quot;m&quot; command.


	 Eero

PS. Quotes evaluate the expression before the command itself is parsed,
but in earlier mail I mentioned about possibility of adding some
syntax with which one can tell that instead an expression within
breakpoint should be evaluated always when that breakpoint is checked.
