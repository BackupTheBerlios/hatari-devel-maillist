<PRE>Le 31/05/2011 23:11, Eero Tamminen a &#233;crit :
&gt;&gt;<i> PS : for those who haven't tried it, just download Steem debug from
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Steem website and simply run it with Wine if you use Linux or OSX.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't like binary blobs, could you mail a screenshot of it and tell what
</I>&gt;<i> exactly in it is nice?
</I>

No, seriously, not again, you already asked me for this :)

Honestly, there's no blobs in Steem, just a zip archive with some 
predefined directories ; unzip, run &quot;wine Steem.exe&quot;, can't be much easier.

Doing screenshots won't help, there's too many functionalities to 
describe ; you need to use it to get an idea of what it does, I think 
the real strength is that everything can be done with the UI in a self 
explanatory way (I don't have anything against CLI, but Monst or Steem 
UI are really much easir to use ; combining Hatari's debuger with such 
UI would be a great match)

Regarding the UI toolkit, I don't think QT would be such a bad choice ; 
at least it's really supported on Windows/Linux/OS X and features all 
the functionnalities of modern toolkit and can be themed to integrate 
with the user's computer.

Also, maybe the debuger's UI could be built in hatari (in a kind of 
&quot;gui-qt&quot; directory for example). It has the advantage of not requiring 
external sockets or things like that (as it's currently the case with 
python's one)
