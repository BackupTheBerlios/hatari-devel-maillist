With what they could help with?  Bindings are useful if one needs to deal
with structs, or serialize objects, but there are no such things involved.

The remote API isn't complex.  It's a bit wide, but very shallow and all
the types are strings, so bindings generation for it sounds pointless.
The main thing in &quot;designing&quot; (basically it has just evolved) the remote
API is to minimize the code needed for it.  Command line options and 
debugger already parse ASCII strings, so that's what the remote API uses.


Conditional breakpoints can be complex, but they're (and will be) parsed
as ASCII strings, so that doesn't have any effect on the complexity of
the remote API.

Some complexity will arrive if the remote API needs to be changed to be
two-way instead of the current one-way (e.g. to handle errors for manually
specifified breakpoint), but again, that's not really something where
bindings will help.  It will be complexity at the client end, not in
&quot;protocol&quot;.
