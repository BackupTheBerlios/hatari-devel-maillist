<PRE>Hello,

by default, Hatari is using linear mixing to average the 3 YM voices and 
get the final sample to play.

Due to the hardware/filters used in a real ST, this doesn't fully match 
the reality, so it's also possible to mix the 3 voices using a table of 
all possible combination measured on an ST (this is in sound.c)

This table method is closer to what should be expected and gives really 
much better/cleaner results when playing samples on STF (by combining 
the 3 YM voices), but it might not please everyone's ears.

So, I'd like to make this the default, but this would need an option to 
change it from the UI easily.

Eero, do you think you could add 2 check boxes to the &quot;sound&quot; panel to 
handle this ?

------------------------------------------

YM voice mixing  [] linear   [] ST table

------------------------------------------

This should change YmVolumeMixing in sound.c to YM_LINEAR_MIXING or 
YM_TABLE_MIXING.

(we could also add some checkboxes to enable some filters, but I have no 
idea of what filters to use for now, so this can be made later)
