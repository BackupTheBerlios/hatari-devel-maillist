Right, it's a small regression compared to the behaviour of the old
automake configuration script.

&gt;<i> As Hatari itself doesn't install any cfg file, it's not a problem for
</I>&gt;<i> file installs, just locating the global config file.
</I>
... so the question is whether the position of the _global_
configuration file should be configurable, too, or whether global
configuration files should always got to /etc ... ?

The right location of the etc directory seems to be a mess, according
to the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, there's also /etc/opt for
software that is installed into /opt, and /etc/local for software that
is installed into /usr/local ...

&gt;<i> &gt; but what it really do is to search for in in $prefix/etc.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's a bit more complicated.  If $prefix is empty, prefix should
</I>&gt;<i> default to /usr.  If prefix is /usr, conf should be in /etc.  Only
</I>&gt;<i> when prefix isn't /usr, conf should be in $prefix/etc. (And that's
</I>&gt;<i> only Linux/Unix...)
</I>
And you have to take into account that Hatari is a relocatable package,
so you can specify prefix=/usr/local during build-time, for example,
but when you install the package later, it can also go to /opt/hatari
instead! (That's why we have the BIN2DATADIR stuff in the sources).

So when you say that putting the global configuration file into /etc
only is not enough, you've got to add some code that determines the
prefix at runtime, then checks whether it's in /usr, /usr/local, /opt
or somewhere else, and then either uses /etc, /usr/local/etc (or
/etc/local), /etc/opt or $prefix/etc as configuration directory.

Quite a mess for a global configuration file that we do not use at all
in most cases, isn't it? And I think implementing the above search
algorithm would rather confuse the users, too, instead of helping them.
So IMHO the current behaviour is good enough already, /etc is a well
known location for global configuration files, and there is of course
always the possibility to add a configuration file in the ~/.hatari/
home directory, too.

It's just a little bit ugly that Hatari spills out the &quot;Configuration
file xy not found&quot; message each time you start the emulator. Maybe we
should change that to a debug log message instead?
