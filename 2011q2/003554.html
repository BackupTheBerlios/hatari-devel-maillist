<PRE>Le 03/06/2011 08:28, Eero Tamminen a &#233;crit :
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     - Run for N cycles
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       (Hatari continue command accepts only instructions, not cycles)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would the last one be useful?
</I>
Depends on the user :) But stopping after &gt;= N cycles elapsed should not 
be that hard.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     - Monitoring reads&amp;   writes to specific address.  Hatari supports
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       only monitoring changes to values, not having breakpoints
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       of reading values or writing the same value
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not supported in current Hatari and quite time consuming, because it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> requires evaluating &quot;memory access&quot; breakpoints on each read/write to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> memory.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have a modified version that does this for my own debugging need, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> could be possible to add some proper hooks in the corresponding memory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> handling functions,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could you mail the patch doing this?
</I>
I don't have a real patch ; just some hardcoded &quot;if&quot; + specific 
addresses, so nothing that can be put in production for now.
We'll see after 1.5 is out :)


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     - Showing breakpoints in instruction dumps.  Hatari breakpoints
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       are more advanced than the trivial address breakpoints...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We can show only PC breakpoint in that case, but it's sure Hatari syntax
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is more advanced than Steem's ont.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> To show PC address breakpoints in disassembly, the code would need to
</I>&gt;<i> separately[1] keep track of address breakpoints.  In that case I guess it
</I>&gt;<i> would make sense to revert the change where I made them to be just
</I>&gt;<i> a wrapper for conditional breakpoints.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This would require changing also the 68kDisass.c code, as breakpoint
</I>&gt;<i> indication being on its own line would look horrible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [1] One more reason for this is that I assume there could be quit
</I>&gt;<i> a lot of these breakpoints (especially if they're easy to add from an UI),
</I>&gt;<i> whereas number of conditional breakpoints is quite limited and they're
</I>&gt;<i> slower to check.  Address breakpoints can be binary searched from an array.
</I>
Yes, there could be 2 categories of breakpoints. Even in current CLI 
debugger this could be better for performance to have &quot;simple&quot; PC 
breakpoints in one list, and more complex breakpoint in a 2nd list.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     - Adding new symbol names for arbitrary addresses one at the time.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       Hatari debugger currently requires new symbols to be added to
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>       a file containing all the symbols + reloading that file
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Can't say, I don't use that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think UI makes that kind of reverse debugging much more convenient as
</I>&gt;<i> you can easily annotate the disassembly as discover what it does.  To make
</I>&gt;<i> it really useful, it would require this symbol information to be savable
</I>&gt;<i> and Hatari to warn if it isn't saved at exit time...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (The way how I have used the current symbols functionality is utilizing
</I>&gt;<i> the symbol information generated by the AHCC compiler/linker.)
</I>
Yes, in that way it could indeed be interesting to &quot;comment&quot; the disasm 
code and have these infos saved in a kind of &quot;debugger snapshot&quot; (I 
don't think it should be saved in the &quot;memory snapshot&quot;)

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     - Stack content display
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Should be in the &quot;easy&quot; section I think, it's just a dump of the memory
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> before the value pointed by A7.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You mean it would be just:
</I>&gt;<i> 	m &quot;a7&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> ?
</I>
m &quot;a7&quot; will display bytes at a7 and more (incrementing). But when you 
want to display the stack you must decrement. For example do something 
like (don't know if this syntax works) :

  m &quot;a7&quot; - $20

Which would display the last 32 bytes before the content of a7

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But with a bit different output; instead of 16x hex values per line,
</I>&gt;<i> a word as 2x hex, 2x ASCII&amp;  decimal&amp;  binary values.  (I.e. using
</I>&gt;<i> same output routine as I mentioned above)
</I>
It's hard to know if the data in the stack are words or longs, so you 
have to pick one format to display them, but there're no rule.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>     - Shift Atari screen contents by 0/2/4/6 bytes
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Not very useful, only use is when trying to debug overscan's emulation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problems, but Hatari is now fairly robust.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I guess it's mean for people debuggign their own code, not the emulator
</I>&gt;<i> itself.  :-)
</I>
Yes, and even so, I think the coded can easily do this in his own code.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> (I think rest of the Steem features can be supported by the Hatari
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> breakpoints.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Steem actually has one more thing not possible in Hatari:
</I>&gt;<i>       - Setting a breakpoint on an interrupt
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any suggestions how to best check for interrupt?
</I>&gt;<i> (I mean, how to express it in breakpoints syntax)
</I>
Each interrupt in calling Exception() in newcpu.c with and exception 
number and and exception source (cpu, mfp). Adding a condition on the 
expception number allows to catch any kind of interrrupt.

&gt;<i> (Only potential small usability downside from working through remote API
</I>&gt;<i> would be this 0.1s delay per view before it gets refreshed that I mentioned
</I>&gt;<i> earlier.)
</I>
I think this 0.1 delay would be really annoying when trying to fast 
scroll pressing page down for example in a memory dump window.

That's why I think an infrastructure that would allow to add several UI 
inside Hatari (depending on the compile time options) would be better, 
as it would bypass any inter-processes communications and the possible 
latency introduced (not counting the required formatting needed to 
exchange data in a parsable way).

&gt;&gt;<i> And a way to search for hexa/text in Hatari's RAM.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This needs a new feature in the internal debugger too.
</I>
I think it could be added rather easily in the current debugger ? Maybe 
with some optional start/end addresses (to search in ram or in rom for 
example).
With the ability to search for several bytes/words/longs at the same time.

search $0-$3000 $1 $45 $1234

optional range is in the form x-y ; if not present defaut to a search in 
the whole ram.

values' size is determined when parsing each value. For example the 
above would look for a byte $1 followed by a byte $45 followed by a word 
$1234.
We could even add text string in the search pattern :

search 'tos ' $45 $18 'atari'
