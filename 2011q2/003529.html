Depends. The most rated comment is negative about wxwidgets while some
of the rest are quite positive. I haven't done much UI so I can't
comment on the frameworks, but Qt has a long history and will probably
support most of the thing needed, even more, out of the box.

</I>
Having seen countless language wars I would say this also depends. I
am not a big fan of C++ either but the 'industry' seems to have
embraced it. To be honest I would also like to see hatari continue in
mainly C.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think a wire protocol would benefit Hatari as well, esp. for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> debugging on devices, for instance N900.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hatari and the PyGtk Hatari UI, including its debugger GUI, worked on
</I>&gt;<i> the N900 phone just fine when I last tested them. &#160;But the debugger UI
</I>&gt;<i> indeed has trouble fitting to the screen even in it's current form.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You should be using Hatari's CLI console from SSH login, that way you
</I>&gt;<i> can use any terminal size you want to.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have been checking the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> options and couldn't decide on the protocol, mainly the serializer.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The current protocol is ASCII strings terminated with newlines, sent over
</I>&gt;<i> a socket. &#160;With ASCII there's no need for serialization, structure/member
</I>&gt;<i> padding/alignment and byte swapping which makes the API easier to use
</I>&gt;<i> &amp; debug:
</I>&gt;<i> - from higher level / script languages
</I>&gt;<i> - by Atari programs utilizing XBios(255) when --bios-intercept is enabled
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Currently only information coming back through that socket is Hatari window
</I>&gt;<i> size changes (needed for window embedding), and even that comes only if
</I>&gt;<i> it was requested.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When adding support for breakpoints to the remote UI, there needs also to be
</I>&gt;<i> information sent through remote API when the internal debugger is invoked,
</I>&gt;<i> with something identifying why (user, breakpoint, exception....) the
</I>&gt;<i> debugger was invoked.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The actual debugger data comes back through a separate, one-way fifo.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> am interested in using thrift (<A HREF="http://wiki.apache.org/thrift/Tutorial">http://wiki.apache.org/thrift/Tutorial</A>)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to remotely debug/control/test hatari but it doesnt support events out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of the box, which makes it a plain RPC and not fit for debugging. JSON
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is of course an option but I really like google-protobuff or thrift,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mainly due to code generation and overall cleaner API that can be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> built with them.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Having a clean protocol also means the UI can be done in any language,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> thrift has bindings for almost every language and it would be easy to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> build an UI that supports both local and remote debugging.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would that add an extra dependency to build process &amp; run-time?
</I>
I haven't done thrift(facebook) but I have done protobuf (google),
they are similar and both needs a lib. I also was skeptical to this
idea first but once I wrote the code-generation for the services I
noticed how clean it made the overall API. Especially when we need to
expose a complicated interface like a debugger and want to extend the
functionality easily, I believe these protocols would work nicely.

On the other hand, there is always string based JSON, which is also
something I like. I said thrift because it comes with a network impl.
whereas in protobuf I had to write the RPC implementation.
