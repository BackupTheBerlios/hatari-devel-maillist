<PRE>Hi,

And e.g. in the Yepyha demo (which has also other issues).

The Stocasto demo freeze is also strange.


&gt;<i> It appears in the 50 first DSP instructions. It's easy to reproduce,

&gt;<i>    - a computing bug ? (I can see it in a screen from Motion demo)
</I>
The graphics in &quot;Agressive II party info&quot; look also different
from the graphics shown on pouet.net.


&gt;<i> For me, nearly all the other bugs are related to timings :
</I>&gt;<i>    - I've already seen working some demos or games by &quot;bad hacking&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> hatari (eg k.prg discuss we had a few month ago)
</I>&gt;<i>    - I've already played to llamazap with hatari
</I>&gt;<i>    - I've already seen rot3dbmp.prg (I had to &quot;bad hack again&quot; the 68030
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;-&gt; DSP synchro)
</I>&gt;<i>    - I've already heard clear sound with DMA play sound (I think it's a
</I>&gt;<i> regression from new CPU)
</I>
I guess it's a related issue with all the Falcon audio apps (AceMidi,
AceTracker, FalcAmp, FlaySid, FlexTrax, GemPlay).  FlaySid &amp; FlexTrax
actually have _no_ sound according to the compatibility list...


&gt;<i>    - if I &quot;bad hack&quot; again with some other values the 68030 &lt;-&gt; DSP
</I>&gt;<i> synchro, _ demo is full working
</I>&gt;<i>    - if I play with -32Mhz, some more demos runs
</I>&gt;<i>    - ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In 99,5% of time, DSP is correctly emulated now (I think it's the most
</I>&gt;<i> robust chip of hatari's falcon emulation)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There a very few programs I have never seen running under hatari.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The progress between hatari 1.0 and hatari 1.5 version for falcon
</I>&gt;<i> emulation is huge (this is of course my point of view).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll continue the effort as much as I can.
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice to be helped by some other atarist :)

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Le 06/06/2011 22:59, Laurent Sallafranque a &#233;crit :
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; OK for video.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; All these questions for DSP &lt; - &gt; 68030 synchro.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; As we use the 68030 as main clock, if we don't take into account all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the waitstates (DMA sound, videl, ...) we can miss a lot of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; clockedges for the DSP speed, no ?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The problem with falcon emu is (I think) that we need to be synchro
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; between 68030 (main clock), DSP and crossbar.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If the 68030 eats some waitstates because of sound DMA or Videl, I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; think we should take them into account for better synchro with the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; DSP and crossbar.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, when there're wait state you need to count them in the cpu cycles
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to run the dsp for the correct amount of time.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Maybe I think wrong and shouldn't worry about these cycles, but they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; seem to be &quot;time consuming&quot; (from Mikro's doc about stRam timings and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 68030)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Depends on what kind of memory the 68030 is accessing. The &quot;normal&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (st compatible ram) is using a 16 bits 16 MHz bus, and this will
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; certainly slow down the 68030 and make it run slower than it should if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you have a lot of RAM accesses.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; If I try to take them into account, hatari becomes horribly slow.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But this is very complicated to take into account. Measuring wait
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; state requires a very precise emulation of all the clocks, and Hatari
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; does not have this, so maybe you're doing something wrong.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Also, I'm not sure that waitstate emulation is the cause of some dsp
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &lt;-&gt; cpu synchro : even on a falcon, the same code will not take the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; same number of cycles, depending on the content of the cpu/data caches.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So even a program on a real Falcon that would expect the dsp&lt;-&gt;cpu
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; synchronisation to work without any sync control is likely to fail
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (unless you take the cache behaviour into account, which is more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complicated when coding in asm).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; That's why I think that for most programs, even a bad number of cycles
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should not create so many bugs. There may be 2 or 3 general issues to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; fix, but I don't think so many things need to be corrected.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; But at one point, I think that what is needed is someone who can code
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on Falcon and provide some very simple programs for dsp/cpu that test
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one particular aspect of the dsp emulation (or the videl part)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Very simple test cases that can be ran on a real Falcon and easily
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; compared on Hatari.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Trying to run a complete demo, with several dsp/cpu/videl techniques
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; used at the same time, makes it very hard to really isolate one single
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem and fix it, instead of combining many problems that can
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; sometimes influence each others.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I had to do the same thing for shifter : at one point trying to debug
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some particular demos was impossible and lead to a dead end. I wrote
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; about 20 simple cases to measure very simple (but very important!)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; aspects, one at a time, by changing only one parameter at a time. And
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; nearly &quot;automatically&quot;, improving Hatari to pass these simple programs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make the corresponding demos run without any error.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't want to sound pessimistic, but unless someone can help with
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some real Falcon coding experiment in video/dsp fields and provide
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some very simple test programs to show some non working aspects in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hatari, then I think it will be very difficult to improve Falcon's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; emulation.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So, any experiment Falcon coder (not me !) should raise his hand :)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
