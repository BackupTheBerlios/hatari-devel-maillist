<PRE>Le 19/07/2011 11:18, Vincent Rivi&#232;re a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Hello.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hatari 1.5.0 has been released, congratulations to all of you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, I notice that inside both the binary and source archives, there
</I>&gt;<i> is a file named tos.img, which is actually an EmuTOS binary.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Providing EmuTOS with Hatari is great for everyone, it allows Hatari to
</I>&gt;<i> be ready to use, and popularize EmuTOS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But EmuTOS is GPL, and you know the GPL rules: you can redistribute any
</I>&gt;<i> binary of GPL software (even modified) as long as you also redistribute
</I>&gt;<i> the exact sources you used to build it. I don't see the EmuTOS sources
</I>&gt;<i> in your download area, so it looks like Hatari is currently violating
</I>&gt;<i> EmuTOS' GPL.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a solution, I propose you to put the exact EmuTOS source tarball you
</I>&gt;<i> used to build tos.img into your download area, near the Hatari source
</I>&gt;<i> tarball. Also, build instructions would be nice, probably as simple as
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;make 512&quot;. This is very easy and I hope this will be OK for you.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks in advance for considering this issue.
</I>&gt;<i>

Hello

Are you sure the GPL requires to put the emutos sources *inside* Hatari 
released archives ?

 From what I understood, the GPL requires to publish the sources you 
modified (which is not our case, we compiled emutos without changing 
anything in the source) and to include some informations about the 
project, which is the case in doc/emutos.txt, with a direct link to 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos">http://sourceforge.net/projects/emutos</A>

Since we didn't modify the source, I don't think the GPL implies we 
distribute a copy of the source, giving an url to the official emutos 
site should be enough to comply.

Many projects are working this way, they include code from zip, openssl, 
freetype, ... as some external libraries, without modifying the code. In 
that case, they give some mandatory informations about each included 
project and how to get the source on thei respective site.

Really, I don't think we're not conforming to the GPL on that point.

Nicolas
