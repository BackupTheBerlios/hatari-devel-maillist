&gt;<i> Le 18/07/2011 02:25, David Savinkoff a &#233;crit :
</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand what you mean. What part of Hatari is not precise,
</I>&gt;<i> and what do you mean by &quot;infinitely precise&quot; for audio ?
</I>
The problem is not too be too precise, the problem is too be precise 
enough so that all emulated programs behave the same on Hatari as on a 
real ST.
I had to use non integer fps, because in the case of the STE video clock 
and dma audio clock are really too different clock.s

As Anders reported, Hatari with video at 50 Hz had some audio/video sync 
problem after a moment in the demo. And the only way to fix this was to 
really have video at 50.053 Hz, or put in another way a VBL that last 
19.979 ms. All ST output PAL video at 50.053 Hz (well some rare models, 
such as Paulo Simoes, were reported to have different clock, but that's 
not the rule).

If you don't do that, at one point the dma player (which is synchronised 
on the audio dma buffer) &quot;skips&quot; one pattern and one sample is looped 
one time too much, because the code that is supposed to run on each VBL 
will not happen at the same &quot;position&quot; in the dma buffer.

More precisely, if you play dma sound at 50066 Hz, after 50 VBL you 
should not have played 50066 samples, but ~50012 samples. If that's not 
the case, some demos will just don't work correctly (Hextracker requires 
this precision, although it also self adapt to the audio variation (when 
running under falcon, steem, 16 Mhz cpu, ...))

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** Hatari is attempting to be too precise.
</I>&gt;<i> ** The audio and video frequencies are 'defined' to be what they are.
</I>
But concretly, Hatari sleeps after each rendered video frame to emulate 
the display freq. Do you mean Hatari should render one frame every 20 
ms, instead of the 19.979 used now in PAL ?

&gt;<i> It's a known fact that apart from the above ntsc/pal fps numbers the ST
</I>&gt;<i> were never precise enough and the output video signal is not exactly the
</I>&gt;<i> PAL value (it's really 50.053 Hz on a PAL ST).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ** 50.053 Hz is close enough to be called 50 Hz.
</I>
I agree, but the problem is not how you call it, it's the timings 
involved behind. Sleeping 20 ms or 19.979 is not the same, it's very 
close, but since it's possible we should respect the maximum accuracy.
The results on the screen could be the same, but that's due to the 
screen which has its own freq, which could be neither 50 HZ nor 50.053 Hz.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Do you recommand to emulate sound and video at 50.053 but to refresh
</I>&gt;<i> screen at 50 Hz ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The video card dictates its approximately 50 Hz refresh rate.
</I>&gt;<i> * Hatari should emulate the video at approximately 50.053 Hz in
</I>&gt;<i>    'emulation space' and the video card will display it in real time
</I>&gt;<i>    at approximately 50 Hz (PAL). To do this, hatari must use a video
</I>&gt;<i>    mode that supports approx 50 Hz. Then hatari 'must' supply video at
</I>&gt;<i>    the rate that the card demands (which probably is not 50.053 Hz).
</I>&gt;<i> * Note that an Atari ST and a PC video card can both display PAL.
</I>&gt;<i>    Thus both operate at a nominal 50 Hz. Nobody can justifiably
</I>&gt;<i>    complain about the emulation speed accuracy because they would be
</I>&gt;<i>    effectively complaining that one real Atari runs at different speed
</I>&gt;<i>    than another real Atari.
</I>
I agree that anyway, Hatari has no way to send the sync signal to start 
a new VBL. So we're bound to what the display driver of the OS is doing.

Also, we have no way from Hatari to know the exact video freq that is 
produced by the video card.

Since we don't know those 2 parameters, the only reasonable thing to do 
for me is to have Hatari generate frames at the rate supposed to be 
produced on a real ST. Maybe, we will be close to the video card freq, 
maybe not, but we can't know ; so why should we favour a 20 ms speed 
instead of 19.979 ?

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why do you say it will keep hardware happy ? I'm not sure Anders is
</I>&gt;<i> speaking about hardware, but about software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Anders problem is Hatari's fault. Hatari should always provide
</I>&gt;<i>    nominal values (eg. 50Hz 44100Hz etc). The exact values are
</I>&gt;<i>    internal just like a real Atari.
</I>
No, for the same reasons, if you want to record avi of what is emulated 
by Hatari, then I think you should put in the avi header the most exact 
value possible (for the same audio/video sync that can appear on STE).

Then, the video player you use can do some more advanced rendering to 
adapt the avi frame rate to your monitor frame rate (motion 
compensation, ...), but I don't think that Hatari has to simplify what 
it generates. A real PAL ST produces 50.053 Hz video, so we should put 
this value in the avi header and let the video player round it to 50 Hz 
while playing if it wants.

But regarding Anders problem, it's just that quicktime doesn't seem to 
support a high precision in the fps_scale values :
  - 50053000 / 1000000 = 50.053, but it will be rejected by 
quicktime/ffmpeg.
  - 50053 / 1000 = 50.053 too, but it will be accepted by quicktime.

&gt;<i> On LCD monitors, it's quite unlikely you can output 50 Hz video, it's
</I>&gt;<i> more often 60 Hz, so having 50 Hz or 50.053 would not change anything in
</I>&gt;<i> the end.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Note that it is the 'video card' that dictates the frequency. The
</I>&gt;<i>    monitor synchronizes to the video card. Hatari must either synchronize
</I>&gt;<i>    to the video card or allow SDL/system to insert or drop a frame
</I>&gt;<i>    periodically. The video card is guaranteed to Not be exactly 60 Hz.
</I>&gt;<i>    I do not recommend synchronizing to the video card because
</I>&gt;<i>    synchronizing to the sound card is better.
</I>
I agree, but since we don't have any mean to synchronise with the video 
card, then it's better to render frame at the rate of a real ST and let 
the video driver drop/skip one refresh on screen from time to time.

It's clear that with most lcd running at 60 Hz, emulating 50 Hz or 
50.053 Hz will just not be in sync and will never give a &quot;smooth&quot; 
display (as on an old Atari's CRT monitor).
