&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> During past few days I wrote a small Python program
</I>&gt;<i> for which you can give an m68k instruction name and
</I>&gt;<i> it will give you a hatari breakpoint to match that
</I>&gt;<i> + some extra info on the instruction (more would be
</I>&gt;<i> easy to add).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It has TAB completion and help too in case you'd like
</I>&gt;<i> to test it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would something like that be an interesting script
</I>&gt;<i> for Hatari?  Or useful even in the debugger itself
</I>&gt;<i> (the attached code can generate a lookup table that
</I>&gt;<i> Hatari could use for that)?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's example output:
</I>&gt;<i> ----------
</I>&gt;<i> m68k-instructions: rte
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Instruction:
</I>&gt;<i>    rte - 0100111001110011
</I>&gt;<i> Hatari breakpoint:

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> m68k-instructions: ext

</I>&gt;<i> Bits:
</I>&gt;<i>    - o: op-mode
</I>&gt;<i>    - r: data / address register

Hello

I can see the purpose of this as a test to manipulate opcodes, but this 
seems over complicated to me to set breakpoint.

Also, it looks like &quot;code&quot; duplication, in the sense that all those 
opcodes are already defined in uae/winuae with more informations 
regarding possible address mode and size.

For example, it would be much too generic with &quot;move&quot; if you just break 
on &quot;move&quot; without being able to specify source/dest.

I think there're 2 cases when you want to add a breakpoint on an 
instruction :
  - you have an example so you can set (pc).w =xxxx
  - you don't know the opcode, in that case I think it would be better 
to do it the other way : go from the text to the opcode

I mean, it would be interesting if the user could say &quot;break when you 
encounter 'move.w d0,(a0)' at the disassembled address&quot;.

So, the user would enter some text to check &quot;str1&quot;.
On each instruction (when breakpoints are checked), internally call the 
disasm function to an internal char buffer &quot;str2&quot; (not stdin). And now 
the hard part : try to do a fuzzy match of &quot;str1 = str2&quot; (standardize 
space/tab, independant case matching, ...). If both strings match, then 
breakpoint is reached.

Of course, the user would need to enter the instruction by respecting 
the disassembler usual output convention, especially regarding how to 
express register, address mode and things like that (for simple 
instruction like rts, rol, jmp, ... that don't have a variety of 
parameters, matching should be rather easy to achieve).

So breakpoint on complex opcodes would just be a matter of entering the 
text in a compatible way with the usual disasm output. Then all the 
disasm work would be done as it's already done today, if new opcodes 
(68030,...) are added, it's automatically available.

You can also adapt this to the dsp case, once you have a flexible enough 
fuzzy matching function, you don't need to know what cpu you're 
handling, it's just strings comparison and it would work also for dsp 
breakpoints.
