Hello

no, ikbd.c doesn't emulate the double buffer. As the code in ikbd.c is 
getting rather complex, I prefered not adding it 2 months ago, unless I 
found a program that really needs it.

But I didn't found a doc that clearly tells what happens to the latch 
and shift register when acia is reset.

In the case of Froggies's menu, move.b #$ff,$fffc02 should set 
tx_latch=$ff and tx_shift=$ff.

But if acia is reset before the whole $ff byte was sent to the ikbd, 
what happens to tx_shift (that was already partially shifted) ?
Or does it mean that after the reset tx_latch is send again ? But that 
seems odd, I would expect tx_latch to be copied in tx_shift only when a 
write is detected in tx_latch.

Why do you say the workaround doesn't work for TX ? On the contrary, it 
works because the $ff byte to be sent to the ikbd is not canceled.

Well, as I said, acia part should be rewritten after doing various 
measures on a real ST, regarding RX and TX delays.
