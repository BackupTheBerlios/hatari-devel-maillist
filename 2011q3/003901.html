<PRE>Hi,

Err, it started from my unhappiness with Markus' code for disassembling
and a thought that I could try out what writing a table based instruction
decoder would need.  Adding command line and breakpoint output to
the table generation python code was kind of an afterthough.


&gt;<i> Also, it looks like &quot;code&quot; duplication, in the sense that all those
</I>&gt;<i> opcodes are already defined in uae/winuae with more informations
</I>&gt;<i> regarding possible address mode and size.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For example, it would be much too generic with &quot;move&quot; if you just break
</I>&gt;<i> on &quot;move&quot; without being able to specify source/dest.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think there're 2 cases when you want to add a breakpoint on an
</I>&gt;<i> instruction :
</I>&gt;<i>   - you have an example so you can set (pc).w =xxxx
</I>
Most of the instructions have different kinds parameters encoded to them,
so unless the instruction doesn't have any (like RTD/RTE/RTR/RTS), or you
want just that specific version of the instruction, you need to know also
the generic form.


&gt;<i>   - you don't know the opcode, in that case I think it would be better
</I>&gt;<i> to do it the other way : go from the text to the opcode
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I mean, it would be interesting if the user could say &quot;break when you
</I>&gt;<i> encounter 'move.w d0,(a0)' at the disassembled address&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, the user would enter some text to check &quot;str1&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i> On each instruction (when breakpoints are checked), internally call the
</I>&gt;<i> disasm function to an internal char buffer &quot;str2&quot; (not stdin). And now
</I>&gt;<i> the hard part : try to do a fuzzy match of &quot;str1 = str2&quot; (standardize
</I>&gt;<i> space/tab, independant case matching, ...). If both strings match, then
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoint is reached.
</I>
Monst's instruction search uses a substring match on the disassembler
output.  User just needs to give the substring in the current
disassembly format.

For example, one could search for &quot;$14(A7&quot; and match:
	move.l D0,$14(A7)

(I would have already added this to Hatari debugger if I were able to
touch Markus' code without an overwhelming urge to fix its indentation.)


&gt;<i> Of course, the user would need to enter the instruction by respecting
</I>&gt;<i> the disassembler usual output convention, especially regarding how to
</I>&gt;<i> express register, address mode and things like that (for simple
</I>&gt;<i> instruction like rts, rol, jmp, ... that don't have a variety of
</I>&gt;<i> parameters, matching should be rather easy to achieve).
</I>
If you sometimes would need to match e.g. all of .b, .w and .l formats,
I could add to the python code a helper for telling you how to mask given
parameters from the given instruction, e.g. with syntax like this:
	&lt;instruction&gt; ?=&lt;parameter type letters&gt;

In the move case, it would look like this:
------
m68k-instructions: move

Instruction:
  move - 00ssyyymmmmmmxxx
Bits:
  - s: size (byte/word/long)
  - y: destination register
  - m: effective address mode
  - x: source register

m68k-instructions: move ?=s
    $cfff
------

-&gt; would give you value to mask the move instruction size out.
    $cfff

You could then use:
	b (pc).w &amp; $cfff = &quot;$3080 &amp; $cfff&quot;


Btw. Any suggestions for which letters to use to have separate ones for
source &amp; destination register op-modes and effective address modes?

These are the letters I currently use:
    's': &quot;size (byte/word/long)&quot;,
    'i': &quot;dynamic, not immediate data&quot;,
    'x': &quot;source register&quot;,
    'y': &quot;destination register&quot;,
    'r': &quot;data / address register&quot;,
    'v': &quot;data value&quot;,
    'o': &quot;op-mode&quot;,
    'm': &quot;effective address mode&quot;,
    'a': &quot;effective address register&quot;,
    't': &quot;instruction type / direction&quot;,
    'c': &quot;condition / count&quot;,
    'p': &quot;displacement&quot;,
    'b': &quot;breakpoint / trap vector&quot;,


&gt;<i> So breakpoint on complex opcodes would just be a matter of entering the
</I>&gt;<i> text in a compatible way with the usual disasm output. Then all the
</I>&gt;<i> disasm work would be done as it's already done today, if new opcodes
</I>&gt;<i> (68030,...) are added, it's automatically available.
</I>
How many new instructions 680[2346]0 have compared to 680[01]0?
Does coldfire have new instructions?


&gt;<i> You can also adapt this to the dsp case, once you have a flexible enough
</I>&gt;<i> fuzzy matching function, you don't need to know what cpu you're
</I>&gt;<i> handling, it's just strings comparison and it would work also for dsp
</I>&gt;<i> breakpoints.
</I>
Sure.
