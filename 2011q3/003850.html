<PRE>Hi,

Hm.  That could explain the mouse isses with Hextracker I commented
in an earlier mail...

&gt;<i> Eero, do you have an idea of what could cause this?

Regarding this comment:
&quot;sets medium resolution and uses a special keyboard/mouse interrupt:&quot;

According to Hatari &quot;--trace ikbd_cmds&quot; trace, Hextracker uses relative
mouse position reporting mode, like GEM does.


As this is the first time I hear from an issue like this, I think the issue
could be on the Hextracker side.  Maybe Hextracker doesn't handle properly
larger relative mouse offsets / movements that are possible with a PC mouse,
mouse acceleration and a windowed Hatari?

There isn't really that much Atari programs that do their own mouse handling
in medium resolution (i.e. with mouse y-direction scaled), so it's possible
that there might be some issue in Hatari too though.

The ikbd.c relative mouse mode handler limits max offset to -128 - 127
and adds keyboard packets in loop until whole mouse movement is processed.


&gt;<i> Even with alt+m it doesn't work.
</I>
Even if mouse is grabbed before starting Hextracker or Hatari is switched
to fullscreen before starting Hextracker?  And if one doesn't invoke Hatari
options dialog (which can cause larger mouse moves after it's closed) while
using Hextracker?


&gt;<i> I never really looked at that part of the code, maybe you
</I>&gt;<i> know it better than me.
</I>
It's been many years[1] since I've looked at that.

The SDL moused events are handled in main.c::Main_HandleMouseMotion()
which basically just gives the relative mouse pointer offsets to ikbd.c
code (after dividing them by zoom factor).

[1] Then the problem was with touchscreens that reported only absolute
    co-ordinates, Hatari (or was it SDL?) didn't handle those properly.
