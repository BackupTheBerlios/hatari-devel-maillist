&gt;<i> But I've guess you already know:)
</I>
Well, no, I didn't :)  Thanks for reporting it.

I just had a quick look at the code (which is rather &quot;compact&quot; not 
always easy to read :) ) and the interesting part is that documentation 
for pasti.dll is included, as well as the header file with the structure 
of the different data.
This could be really helpful to write our own pasti implementation as 
this help understanding the disk format (sarnau also wrote a very good 
reverse engineering doc on pasti to complement this).

Regarding Hatari's emulation, I'm not sure it can help improving 
accuracy in Hatari. IMO, we already reached a far better overall 
compatibility level than Steem.

But in some cases where Steem has better support for a particular 
game/demo, it could be helpful to see how they handled it (although I 
prefer figuring it out myself, much more fun :) )


So, if you know some program that work correctly under Steem and not 
Hatari, just let us know.

Another good news with the source release is that I will be able to 
compile an up to date linux binary that use the most recent alsa/audio 
driver, as the latest release steem binary really has problem when alsa 
or pulseaudio are used instead of OSS driver (no sound output).


And good move from Steem's authors, I don't know if some coders will 
work on this sources to add new functionnalities, but at least it will 
help ensuring it can be built on more recent OS versions (windows or linux).


Nicolas
