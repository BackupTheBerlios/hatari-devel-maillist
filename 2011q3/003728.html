<PRE>It's a bit what I think.

If winuae emulates a 32 bits 68030, cycles are &quot;faster&quot; than on the real 
hatari (16 bits bus).
This may explain a part of the synch problems we encounter

I've got some other demos that do as you did (synch DSP for each send 
data but synch the 68030 only for the first receive data and then run 
without synch):

- underscore demo (in the 3d tubular labyrinth)
- rot3dbmp
- bound3
- ...

This is the key to a good falcon emu.

And the 2 componants that are probably not well accurate are the 68030 
(16 bits bus) and the Videl.
(I think DSP cycles are correctly handled now, except perhaps a very few 
ones or very special cases)

And as the 68030 is the clock for the whole computer, it should be very 
accurate.

I asked once about the falcon's timings of exceptions :

In newcpu.c :: Exception_normal(), I can read the following :

       case 2: M68000_AddCycles(50); break;    /* Bus error */
       case 3: M68000_AddCycles(50); break;    /* Address error */
       case 4: M68000_AddCycles(34); break;    /* Illegal instruction */
       case 5: M68000_AddCycles(38); break;    /* Div by zero */
       case 6: M68000_AddCycles(40); break;    /* CHK */
       case 7: M68000_AddCycles(34); break;    /* TRAPV */
       case 8: M68000_AddCycles(34); break;    /* Privilege violation */
       case 9: M68000_AddCycles(34); break;    /* Trace */
       case 10: M68000_AddCycles(34); break;    /* Line-A - probably 
wrong */
       case 11: M68000_AddCycles(34); break;    /* Line-F - probably 
wrong */
       default:
         /* FIXME: Add right cycles value for MFP interrupts and copro 
exceptions ... */
         if(nr &lt; 64)
           M68000_AddCycles(4);            /* Coprocessor and unassigned 
exceptions (???) */
         else
           M68000_AddCycles(44+12);        /* Must be a MFP or DSP 
interrupt */
         break;
     }

Are these timings still OK for a Falcon ?
I think they're OK for an atari ST(e)

Is access to memory always rounded to the next 4 cycles ?
(saw in memory.c)

The DMA (sound) and the videl super access mode (17 cycles to read 19 
words at once if I'm right) stop the bus and generates WAITSTATES.

In the case of the unsynched DSP-68030 demos, these extra cycles slows 
down a little the 68030, which gives some time to the DSP to execute one 
more instruction (sometimes).


You see, there are plenties of explanations for the &quot;not enough acurate 
Falcon&quot; emuation.

And Maybe Nicolas's right : there's probably a very big problem hidden 
somewhere we've not seen yet.
But : ST emulation is quite accurate now (which means a certain amount 
of quality has been reached in Hatari),
         and  There are plenties of Falcon programs that run well (music 
+ sound), in different modes (video, DSP or not, DMA or not, ...)

That's why I think now that programs with problems are those who need 
accuracy.
When I trace them, it's very often the DSP that is looping waiting a 
data that came to early or progs that are running a bit too fast for the 
68030, or ...


(I except here Build in Obsolescence demo which have a real different 
problem I still haven't found yet).


Best regards,

Laurent

</I>&gt;<i>     So, do you mean this demo could not run correctly on a real
</I>&gt;<i>     &quot;stock&quot; Falcon with 68030 ? A 060 is really needed ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, the opposite :) It runs well on real stock Falcon but it does not 
</I>&gt;<i> on Falcon + CT60 because the CPU is just too fast (grabbing data from 
</I>&gt;<i> DSP faster than DSP could provide it when playback is active). I 
</I>&gt;<i> wanted to point out maybe your Hatari CPU emulation is also a bit 
</I>&gt;<i> faster than it should.
