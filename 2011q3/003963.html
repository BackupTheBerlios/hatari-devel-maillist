<PRE>Le 24/08/2011 23:05, Laurent Sallafranque a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Just a though: Did you disable really all interrupts before starting
</I>&gt;<i> your benchmark loop? I had a quick look at your sourcecode, and you
</I>&gt;<i> disable the MFP interrupts there, but I did not see that you've
</I>&gt;<i> increased the IPL to disable VBL interrupts? So if some VBL interrupts
</I>&gt;<i> occur during your measurement, these might mess up the results. That
</I>&gt;<i> might also be an explanation for the differences, since the VBLs are
</I>&gt;<i> not emulated correctly in Falcon mode yet, are they?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What changes would you suggest in my source ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> VBL is not yet implemented, but as I do STOP #$2300 (to wait a VBL) and
</I>&gt;<i> then I loop 100, 500 or 1000 NOPS, I thought there can't be a VBL (it
</I>&gt;<i> should be more than 100 000 cycles, no ?)
</I>
You can add after stopping mfp :

	move.l	#Int_Empty,$70.w

If a VBL int is very long, it could delay the stop 2300 too much and 
then your wait loop could be interrupted by the next vbl (especially for 
the 10000 case).

Putting an empty vbl can not hurt.


I don't think the 68030 runs too fast, the cycle count should be correct 
(that's just some nops, 4 cycles). Then the dsp number of cycles for 
each run is computed from the 68030 number of cycles, so this should not 
be wrong (if we assume 16 MHz for cpu and 32 for dsp)

Possible problem could be that the dsp doesn't emulate some instruction 
cases with the correct number of cycles, and this would create the 
observed difference.
