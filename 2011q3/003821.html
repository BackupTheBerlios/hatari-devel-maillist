Thanks for your expertise.

So it appears that:

1) The EmuTOS splashscreen is annoying for the users. So this is an 
EmuTOS issue, unrelated to Hatari. About the clear screen problem for 
autobooting games, I don't think it is an issue anymore because the 
spashscreen clears the screen before continuing booting. To be 
investigated further (not here). Personally I often use the splashscreen 
to press C to boot EmuCON or Ctrl to bypass the AUTO/ACC, and I 
currently I can't do that with Hatari.

2) Hatari, by design, starts in warm reset mode. I noticed that this is 
true in ST mode, but not in Falcon mode, since I reported that the 
EmuTOS splashscreen correctly shows up in Falcon mode.
The warm reset boot mode is faster (no spashscreen, memory test...) but 
it is inconsistent with real hardware.

What about adding an option to Hatari ?
(check box) Always boot in warm reset mode (faster)
And check it by default.

That way, everyone will be happy: speed and accuracy will be available.

&gt;<i> Concerning your crash with the Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Del, you're right, this
</I>&gt;<i> should certainly not crash and needs some investigation...
</I>
I suspected this problem was related to the warm boot issue, but maybe 
this is a totally different problem.
