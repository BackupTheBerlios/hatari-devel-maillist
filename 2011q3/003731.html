<PRE>Hi,

Verified.

</I>
Maybe the problem comes from:
&gt;<i>         Sint64          ticks_micro;
</I>&gt;<i>         struct timeval  now;
</I>&gt;<i>         gettimeofday ( &amp;now , NULL );
</I>&gt;<i>         ticks_micro = now.tv_sec * 1000000UL + now.tv_usec;
</I>&gt;<i>         return ticks_micro;
</I>
now.tv_sec is a signed long which is multiplied with 10^6 unsigned long
and added with signed long and then assigned to a signed longlong.

In C, the result of signed overflow is undefined, and therefore
the whole program state is undefined after one:

GCC at optimization level -O3 (maybe even at -O2) assumes that the compiled
code is correct and therefore optimizes code with the assumption that there
aren't signed overflows.

The first multiplication can overflow and so can the addition.
First multiplication actually overflows already at epoc + 1 (= 1971).

I guess in this case the result of multiplication &amp; addition results
are signed as is the longlong where they're assigned i.e. they all are 
undefined.  And that in my case the result of the optimized calculation
happens to get truncated and be identical on every call.


I'm now testing the following fix:
-        ticks_micro = now.tv_sec * 1000000UL + now.tv_usec;
+        ticks_micro = (Sint64)now.tv_sec * 1000000 + now.tv_usec;

And so far it seems good.

It should take 100 000 years before it starts wrapping again whereas
gettimeofday() timeval struct seconds value wraps in couple of decades...
