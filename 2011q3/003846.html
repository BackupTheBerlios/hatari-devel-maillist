&gt;<i> Hello
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> following a report by Paulo Simoes that tos crashed when using a
</I>&gt;<i> simple program to change video freq, I searched further and it turned
</I>&gt;<i> out it has nothing to do with video freq, but it's related to the
</I>&gt;<i> pterm 0x4c function from gemdos.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Here's the source code :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> CLR.W -(A7)
</I>&gt;<i> MOVE.W #$4c,-(A7)
</I>&gt;<i> TRAP.L #$1
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, very simple, just a call to pterm.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> When HD emulation is used (using host's filesystem), this program
</I>&gt;<i> will crash with the following tos : 1.00 US, 1.02US, 1.02UK, 1.02FR
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It works with tos 1.04FR, 1.62
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It also work with TOS 1.00 or 1.02 when ran from a floppy image (no
</I>&gt;<i> HD emulation)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> HD emulation intercepts gemdos handler and pass it in cart_asm.s ;
</I>&gt;<i> but function 0x4c is not supposed to be intercepted and should call
</I>&gt;<i> the original tos' handler, so there shouldn't be a crash.
</I>&gt;<i> Or maybe pterm is calling later a specific gemdos function used by hd 
</I>&gt;<i> emulation ? (but I just see a call to 0x48 malloc)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thomas, do you have any idea on this and what could go wrong ? Are
</I>&gt;<i> some patches needed in tos.c for those version ?
</I>
I've got an idea what could be causing the crash. TOS 1.00 and 1.02 do
not feature the Pexec(6, ...) call yet, so the code in cart_asm.s has
to use Pexec(4, ...) instead:

	...
	cmp.w	#$0015,d0
	bge.s	use_gemdos_015
	move.w	#4,(a6)		; pexec mode 4 for exec. prepared program
	bra.s	mode0_ok
use_gemdos_015:
	move.w	#6,(a6)		; On GEMDOS 0.15 and higher, we can use mode 6
mode0_ok:
	...

That means that the memory of the executed program is not freed at the
end on TOS 1.00 and 1.02. That's ugly, but it works at least for a
while as long as the called programs shrink their own initial memory
block (which can be the whole memory in some cases) with Mshrink() in
their startup code -- that's what most clean programs do anyway.

But if a program does not shrink it's memory block, and for example
just returns immediately, the memory is not freed anymore during Pterm,
so there is no free memory left ==&gt; crash.

Possible solutions:
- It might be possible to patch the OSHEADER-&gt;p_run variable to point
  to the new basepage before executing the Pexec(4) call already, maybe
  that helps to assign the memory to the new program instead, so that
  it gets freed during its Pterm call. However, I am not sure whether
  this will really work or whether there might be any ugly side-effects
  instead.
- Maybe we could hook into the Pterm call, too, and when the program
  terminates, we call Mfree() instead. However, as soon as the program
  tries to run other programs with Pexec() again (i.e. nested Pexec and
  Pterm calls), this gets very ugly...
- Simply disallow GEMDOS HD with TOS 1.00 and 1.02 or at least warn the
  user with an annoying alert box.

&gt;<i> Or should we warn user about crash when HD is used with those TOS ?
</I>
It's at least mentioned in the manual already since a long time:

&quot;The GEMDOS drive emulation does not work (very well) with TOS 1.00 and
 1.02. Use at least TOS 1.04 if you want the GEMDOS drive emulation to
 work properly.&quot;
