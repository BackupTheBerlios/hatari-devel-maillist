I added some debug output to Hatari with the attached patch and
this is what mouse movement events SDL reports...

1. On pressing F11 to switch to FULLSCREEN
   mouse: abs (840, 525) rel (424, 237)

2. On pressing F11 to switch to WINDOWED mode
   mouse: abs (412, 261) rel (-428, -264)

3. On pressing F11 to switch to FULLSCREEN
   mouse: abs (840, 525) rel (428, 264)

4. On pressing F11 to switch to WINDOWED mode
   mouse: abs (412, 261) rel (-428, -264)

Between F11 presses I didn't move the mouse.

&quot;abs&quot; is the absolute mouse co-ordinates reported by SDL
and &quot;rel&quot; is the reported relative offset that gets given
to IKBD (after it's scaled down by the zoom factor).


As you can see, the mouse movements come from X11/SDL, Hatari
just propagates them to the emulated program.


Either user needs to use grab/fullscreen, or Hextracker needs
to be fixed.   Personally I would prefer the latter, the mouse
moves annoyingly slowly in it.
