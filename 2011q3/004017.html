<PRE>Hello Laurent,

first, my huge apologies, I totally overlooked the file you had sent me! So
my answer is yes, the format is ok, if you manage to create complete text
(adressing modes etc) from the Motorola PDF (be sure you use this as a
source, various text files floating around are not always 100% correct!),
hopefully I manage to make a script which recalculates the numbers for
Falcon timing.

For example, could you explain me in a few words how to read the numbers
&gt;<i> from the file I've sent you ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> cache     : x(y,z,t)
</I>&gt;<i> non cache : a(b,c,d)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> how should I use these x y z t values ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And what are the 2 numbers before ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Those two numbers (not included in your example, right?) are head and tail
values, i.e. how much the instruction overlap with the next and previous
one. For example:

i1: cycles = 3, h = 2, tail = 1
i2: cycles = 4, h = 2, tail = 0
i3: cycles = 2, h = 1, tail = 0

in normal case, the instructions would take 3 + 4 + 2 = 9 cycles. But we
see, there is some overlapping: tail1 and head2 cut down 1 cycle
(min(tail[n-1],head[n])) but unfortunately, tail2 and head3 cut down zero
cycles (min(tail2,head3) = min(0,1) = 0). So thanks to the tail/head
mechanism, we've saved 1 cycle and the overall execution time is going to be
8 cycles.

y, z, t and b, c, d values represent the bus activity: data read,
instruction prefetch and data write. Cache and non-cache means if the value
is already in the data or instruction cache. Obvious case is the instruction
prefetch, once it is in a cache, it takes zero cycles.

The whole idea / purpose of this conversion we are talking about is to
calculate the number of internal cycles (i.e. the 'raw' CPU activity,
without any bus access). We get this number as:

(total number of cycles) - (number of bus activity cycles) = (number of
internal cycles)

Once we have this number (internal cycles), we can re-calculate the bus
activity (4 clock cycles for 1 bus cycle plus split every instruction for
byte+word and long access, since these numbers differ on Falcon 16-bit bus).

Btw all this math is nicely explained in 68030 UM, the paragraph above
specially on a page 11-25. Plus, I've tried to explain this calculation also
in my document about this, I'm so sorry it isn't that clear :)
