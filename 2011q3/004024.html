<PRE>Hi,

Mails about new patches added to BerliOS patch tracker are sent
only to project developers.  The patch is here:

A fairly commonly used one for C-code is Check:

If the patches are reasonable so that we can see when reviewing them
that they don't break existing functionality and you have tested
them yourself, they're fine without automated tests.

But if you want add automated tests, that would be great!

Deniz was interested about test automation, so he might be
interested to look into that.  Deniz?

Thanks, it's much better now!

The re-factored parts (macros changed to functions that handle both
class 0 &amp; 1) look OK and Thomas can check the added commands, I just
wonder why &quot;b&quot; isn't unsigned like command array members are:
-------------------------
-	/* command byte sent, store it. */
-	HDCCommand.command[HDCCommand.byteCount] = 
(DiskControllerWord_ff8604wr&amp;0xFF);
+	/* command byte sent */
+	char b = DiskControllerWord_ff8604wr &amp; 0xFF;
+
+	/* Extract target and extended mode early, read acsi opcode */
+	if (HDCCommand.readCount == 0)
+	{
+		HDCCommand.target = ((b &amp; 0xE0) &gt;&gt; 5);
+		HDCCommand.opcode = (b &amp; 0x1F);
+		HDCCommand.extended = (HDCCommand.opcode == 0x1F);
+	}
+	/* In extended mode, the scsi opcode is at position 1 */
+	else if (HDCCommand.extended &amp;&amp; HDCCommand.readCount == 1)
+	{
+		HDCCommand.opcode = (b &amp; 0xFF);
+	}
... 
   unsigned char command[6]; 
-  short int returnCode;  /* return code from the HDC operation */
+  short int returnCode;      /* return code from the HDC operation */
 } HDCOMMAND;
-------------------------

</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
Like all languages, both C and C++ have their own pros and cons.

Hatari and code that it has adopted have old roots and they've been in C.
Only in the few last years the things adopted from other projects have
started to be C++.  C++ code requires a C++ compiler and isn't fully
compatible with C (C99).

If you'd like to propose a switch from C to C++, please start separate
mail thread about that.

Btw. I assume your &quot;do right&quot; comment means adhering to some restricted
subset of C++, like all sensible C++ projects do, see for example:
  <A HREF="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/C___Portability_Guide">https://developer.mozilla.org/en/C___Portability_Guide</A>


&gt;<i> &gt; I've written tests[1] for the Hatari debugger code I've developed,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; but otherwise it doesn't have regression tests.  Additional tests
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would be welcome though!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; [1] See the stuff under tests/ directory in Hatari sources:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    <A HREF="http://hg.berlios.de/repos/hatari/file/tip/tests">http://hg.berlios.de/repos/hatari/file/tip/tests</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I took a look at these, but they are pretty &quot;manual&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aren't there any good test frameworks for C with automatic
</I>&gt;<i> execution of all tests and a report afterwards?
</I>
I think integrating the tests to such frameworks is (at least) as
much extra code as the &quot;manual&quot; side of my tests.

I wanted also to test quality side and didn't want to add extra deps,
that's why the tests are manual, running them through Valgrind &amp; GCC
mudflap requires just specifying another make target.

But if somebody adds a nice testing framework support &amp; tests using
that to Hatari, I would be happy to (eventually) change my tests to
use it.

Minimum requirement is that this test framework can &quot;automatically&quot;
run the tests also through Valgrind:
