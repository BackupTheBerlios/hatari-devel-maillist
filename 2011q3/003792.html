I agree that it's ugly, but it's not completely without use,
at least for some people.

On OSX windowed mode is apparently very slow, so fullscreen helps.

Fullscreen also takes a grab and F11 is easier to press than AltGr+M.

However, the current fullscreen resolution switch causes pause &amp; music skip
+ messes up multimonitor setup.


&gt;<i> I agree that with extended resolution in TT/Falcon or VDI mode it can be

</I>&gt;<i> more confusion than it solves problem.
</I>
So, maybe have it just as command line &amp; config option that isn't
on by default?


&gt;<i> People could be interested in a general (more complex to code) solution
</I>&gt;<i> that allows full resizing of the Hatari's window, but I'm not sure this
</I>&gt;<i> option would be used in STF/STE mode.
</I>
Sure, having integer scaling for ST/STE would also be nice, but that
needs rewriting quite a bit of screen handling code.  It's not really
interesting to me, so somebody else needs to scratch his/her itch.

(And I don't want to lose the &quot;update only changed parts of screen&quot; as
that reduces Hatari CPU usage a lot, especially on low end (mobile)
devices.)
