&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> just curious, in what state is the current implementation of the &quot;new&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> CPU emulation, i.e. the one from WinUAE? To me it seems like a worse
</I>&gt;<i> option all the time -- the emulation speed is much much slower than the
</I>&gt;<i> original CPU, I've tried this: <A HREF="http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=57787">http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=57787</A> and
</I>&gt;<i> it works perfectly on the old CPU but gives me a bunch of bus errors in
</I>&gt;<i> the new CPU... I ask because I had an impression the new one is better,
</I>&gt;<i> more accurate, maybe even faster than the old one?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
New cpu's integration is far from being complete (it will be complete 
when it can also replace the old cpu and run all STF/STE games/demos 
without any timings problem).
I don't think the 68030 emulation should slow down emulation that much, 
the cpu core structure is rather similar to the one in UAE, it just 
handles more opcodes and also different level of emulation (so I think 
WinUAE core should give similare results to UAE core in STF/STE mode)

But I think laurent also used some specific/more accurate dsp code when 
compiling with the winuae core, so this might not affect only cpu speed, 
but also other component.

In the meantime, until everything is fixed, it's quite possible that 
some demos that don't require the extra level of accuracy from WinUae 
core (68030 cycle counting) will run slower than with old UAE core.

All of this is still work in progress.


&gt;<i> Also, something has happened to the sound emulation, I can't easily
</I>&gt;<i> switch it on and off, even with the reset machine option, the whole
</I>&gt;<i> emulator hangs and I need to kill it :-/ (not that I need it, my poor
</I>&gt;<i> dual core 1.6 GHz notebook can only dream about Falcon emulation with
</I>&gt;<i> sound ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Can't say about this, Laurent will certainly answer.
