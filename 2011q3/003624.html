<PRE>Hello

I just committed the result of my work on improving STE sound quality 
during the last weeks.

-&gt; go to the end of this mail if you're not interested in the technical 
explanations :)

To simplify, there were 2 kinds of problem :

  - the number of samples to emulate per VBL was not precise enough ; it 
was even wrong in fact.

  - the dma audio internal work was not fully, most notably the 8 bytes 
FIFO was missing, which is essential to a correct sound emulation


For the 1st point, the bad number of sample could be seen for example in 
&quot;More or less zero&quot; by DHS. After the plasma and the spec512 image, 
there should be a kind of white &quot;flash&quot; when the next screen start which 
should be synchronised with a sound.

The problem is that all sound emulation was based on the assumption that 
the video runs at 50 Hz (PAL mode). But in fact this is wrong, a real ST 
provides approx 50.053 VBL per sec ! (a VBL is 160256 cycles, which is 
not an exact divider of the 8.021247 clock freq).

In order to fix this, I added a new file clocks_timings.c ; the purpose 
of this file is to put all the hardware's clocks informations for all 
emulated Atari machines in a single file. This file then provides some 
functions to compute the exact values of VBL per sec, length of a VBL in 
micro sec, ...

I went through the official schematics of all known Atari models in 
order to describe the relation between all the clocks (some clocks are 
derived from master clocks)

Note that although the clock for each component is defined in this file, 
it doesn't mean that changing it will have an effect on the emulation 
(that's the plan for later versions at least) (for example, changing cpu 
clock won't make the cpu go faster or slower)

So for now, consider this file as a kind of improved documentation with 
some useful wrappers for some video timings.

Regarding the 50 Hz problem, it was previously admitted that when 
emulating sound at 44100 Hz, this meant 44100/50=882 samples per VBL.
With a real 50.053 VBL per sec value, you can see that the number of 
sample per VBL is in fact ~881.066.

Precision is very important, numbers should not be truncated, so all 
computations are made with 64 bit integers, to emulate a 32 bit integer 
part and a 32 bit fractional part.

Those changes mainly applied to sound.c


For the 2nd point, it was the inner DMA audio emulation that needed 
improvements. This was quite hearable in Hextracker by Paulo Simoes : 
the sound was perturbated by some small &quot;clicks&quot; or some kinds of 
background &quot;static&quot; noise that altered the expected result.

At this point, emulating the 8 bytes FIFO used by the DMA audio was 
necessary, as this gives seamless playback when using double buffer to 
produce sound : the new buffer's address is enabled by turning DMA audio 
off and on. the fact is that during the time DMA is off to prepare the 
next buffer addresses, the sound is not disabled ! As long as the FIFO 
has some bytes left, it produces sound even when DMA audio is off.

I wrote some small test programs to precisely measures how the DMA audio 
FIFO is filled/emptied at each HBL (many thanks to Anders / Evil for 
running these on his STE and sending me the results).
Using those results, I was able to finetune Hatari's emulation and to 
verify the DMA audio / FIFO are now behaving just like a real STE (for 
example, after 50 VBL Hatari now only has a 0 or 2 bytes difference with 
the measured number of bytes played at 50066 Hz on a real STE : 50018 or 
50020 instead of 50020 on a real STE).
This certainly makes Hatari the most accurate emulator regarding STE 
sound :) (Steem produces ~50152 bytes for the same test, haven't tested 
with Saint)


The code I committed contains some debug traces and a lot of variables 
need to be saved in the memory snapshot ; don't worry about this, I will 
clean everything once I get enough feedback to consider the code as stable.


Non tech part :
---------------

Please test this new version with all your favorite STE programs. For 
great results, don't forget to run Hextracker which gives really clear 
output even with 7 voices or more. &quot;Amiga Demo 2&quot; by Leonard/Oxygene now 
also has a very good sound output.

I didn't have time to look at all the demos in the compatibilty list, 
don't hesitate to test the ones known to have a bad sound and to report 
the new results.


Regarding Hatari 1.5 release, I think this should now be very close. 
Once I get enough confirmation that nothing is broken with this new 
code, I will clean some unused parts, modify the memory snapshot format 
to save those new structures (sorry, it won't be possible to reload 
snapshot made with Hatari 1.4) and we should be good :)


PS : could someone with OSX access add the 2 files clocks_timings.c/.h 
to the project, else it might not compile anymore.


Nicolas
