&gt;<i> Le 18/07/2011 02:25, David Savinkoff a &#233;crit :
</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&lt;snip&gt;

I had to use non integer fps, because in the case of the STE video clock 
and dma audio clock are really too different clock.s

As Anders reported, Hatari with video at 50 Hz had some audio/video sync 
problem after a moment in the demo. And the only way to fix this was to 
really have video at 50.053 Hz, or put in another way a VBL that last 
19.979 ms. All ST output PAL video at 50.053 Hz (well some rare models, 
such as Paulo Simoes, were reported to have different clock, but that's 
not the rule).

If you don't do that, at one point the dma player (which is synchronised 
on the audio dma buffer) &quot;skips&quot; one pattern and one sample is looped 
one time too much, because the code that is supposed to run on each VBL 
will not happen at the same &quot;position&quot; in the dma buffer.

* This is done in 'emulator time', isn't real time external to hatari?
  (If your PC/system/videocard runs fast so will hatari)

More precisely, if you play dma sound at 50066 Hz, after 50 VBL you 
should not have played 50066 samples, but ~50012 samples. If that's not 
the case, some demos will just don't work correctly (Hextracker requires 
this precision, although it also self adapt to the audio variation (when 
running under falcon, steem, 16 Mhz cpu, ...))

&lt;snip&gt;

But concretly, Hatari sleeps after each rendered video frame to emulate 
the display freq. Do you mean Hatari should render one frame every 20 
ms, instead of the 19.979 used now in PAL ?

* It doesn't matter whether if you sleep a bit more or a bit less
  because SDL/system will insert or drop one frame in 952.381 frames.
  (20.000 - 19.979)/20.000 = 952.381
  Which takes 19 seconds. The sleep() function has its timebase on a
  clock that is separate from both the sound card and the video card.
  This will create sleep jitter that causes gratuitously dropped 'and'
  inserted frames anyways.

&lt;snip&gt;

I agree that anyway, Hatari has no way to send the sync signal to start 
a new VBL. So we're bound to what the display driver of the OS is doing.

Also, we have no way from Hatari to know the exact video freq that is 
produced by the video card.

Since we don't know those 2 parameters, the only reasonable thing to do 
for me is to have Hatari generate frames at the rate supposed to be 
produced on a real ST. Maybe, we will be close to the video card freq, 
maybe not, but we can't know ; so why should we favour a 20 ms speed 
instead of 19.979 ?

* I agree 

&lt;snip&gt;

&gt;<i> * Anders problem is Hatari's fault. Hatari should always provide
</I>&gt;<i>    nominal values (eg. 50Hz 44100Hz etc). The exact values are
</I>&gt;<i>    internal just like a real Atari.
</I>
No, for the same reasons, if you want to record avi of what is emulated 
by Hatari, then I think you should put in the avi header the most exact 
value possible (for the same audio/video sync that can appear on STE).

* The generated .avi file should specify 50 Hz (20ms) and 44100 Hz
  even though hatari did 19.979 ms internally. The .avi file would
  play properly everywhere and be 3.78 seconds slow for every hour
  in length. I challenge anyone to sit in a dark room without a
  clock and perceive exactly one hour to within 3.78 seconds.

&lt;snip&gt;

it generates. A real PAL ST produces 50.053 Hz video, so we should put 
this value in the avi header and let the video player round it to 50 Hz 
while playing if it wants.

* If you recorded a real Atari with a real video recorder, there
  would be no mention of 50.053 Hz.
