<PRE>Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Anyhow, there is also google code, github, etc... Depends on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; criteria for choosing.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd say, the top requirements are:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Source code repository with a proper VCS (IMHO I would not use
</I>&gt;<i>   anything else beside Mercurial or git anymore).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - Webspace for our Hatari website
</I>&gt;<i> - Enough space for storing our release-tarballs
</I>&gt;<i> - Mailing list
</I>&gt;<i> - Bugtracker (could be handled via webspace also)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Apart from these top requirements, there are some other nice-to-have
</I>&gt;<i> features like forums, but since we hardly use them (and there are
</I>&gt;<i> alternatives like the Hatari forum on atari-forum.com instead), it's
</I>&gt;<i> not so important to have them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So I think we can drop Google Code - since they do not provide webspace
</I>&gt;<i> for project, do they?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if we were to use the most popular revision tool, I guess we would
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; use cvs or svn (if we only take into account the number of users /
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; projects using it).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, agreed, for the development style we use with Hatari, we could
</I>&gt;<i> also use a centralized VCS like SVN again, but IMHO the distributed
</I>&gt;<i> VCSes are really really better, e.g. because they also allow offline
</I>&gt;<i> development etc.
</I>&gt;<i> CVS is really a pain, and in SVN I don't like the branch and tag
</I>&gt;<i> handling, so I'd really say we stick with a distributed VCS instead ;-)
</I>
Couldn't agree more with all of above!


&gt;<i> &gt; I personnaly prefer to stay with mercurial, I don't see any point in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; using git over mercurial for our own development (which honnestly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't really make use of mercurial features that much in fact, we
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; never really created branches or things like that to support several
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hatari versions at a time).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am using git a lot at work nowadays, and I have to say, it's really a
</I>&gt;<i> very powerful and good tool. When we moved away from CVS a couple of
</I>&gt;<i> years ago, there were some reasons to use mercurial instead:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - git is harder to learn, that still applies today, but now there are
</I>&gt;<i>   more people around who already know it
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - there was hardly any git support for Windows users ... I think that
</I>&gt;<i>   has also changed a lot during the last years.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So IMHO we could also switch to git nowadays, but we don't really need
</I>&gt;<i> it for our development style, so we can also stick with Mercurial
</I>&gt;<i> instead.
</I>
If somebody prefers Git, this plugin can be used as git / hg bridge:

	<A HREF="https://github.com/blog/439-hg-git-mercurial-plugin">https://github.com/blog/439-hg-git-mercurial-plugin</A>

There are also scripts for Git:

&gt;<i> &gt; Let's see what hosting solutions we can find for mercurial, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; not sure sourceforge is the way to go (unless they really changed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; their policy lately)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> IIRC these were the main problems with SourceForge in the past:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - They disabled access to the raw CVS repository, you could only used
</I>&gt;<i>   checked-out versions of the files ==&gt; this does not apply anymore for
</I>&gt;<i>   distributed VCSes since you always get the full repository now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - They did not offer modern VCS at that point in time, SVN support just
</I>&gt;<i>   started, but neither Mercurial or Git were available ==&gt; This has
</I>&gt;<i>   changed completely
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - The servers became terribly slow, releasing a tarball was a pain
</I>&gt;<i>   ==&gt; As far as I know, they use faster servers now
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - The website became very hard to use while they tried to renew the
</I>&gt;<i>   design and handling of the pages ==&gt; It's much better nowadays.
</I>
It still has lots of adverts.  I think PCs and Browser have just gotten
much faster at loading &amp; showing them...


&gt;<i> Most of the old pain points are vanished, so if we want to have an
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;easy&quot; solution (I mean, the old Hatari project is still registered
</I>&gt;<i> there), we should consider going back to SourceForge.
</I>
...but SF could be OK.


&gt;<i> Apart from SourceForge, I think these are good alternatives:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> * www.nongnu.org : Uses pretty much the same web interface as berlios
</I>&gt;<i>   since both are derived from earlier versions of SourceForge, so we
</I>&gt;<i>   might feel at home there quite fast. Major drawback: They are very,
</I>&gt;<i>   very picky about the GNU philosophie, e.g. we would first need to
</I>&gt;<i>   replace Linux by GNU/Linux everywhere in our code and documentation,
</I>&gt;<i>   and IIRC they prohibit that a program links against a non-free
</I>&gt;<i>   library (which is not a problem for us yet, but we might need this
</I>&gt;<i>   one day for Pasti or one of the other disk image libraries).
</I>
Maybe also:
	<A HREF="http://alioth.debian.org/">http://alioth.debian.org/</A>
?

&gt;<i> * github.com or gitorious.org ... we should also consider those if we
</I>&gt;<i>   decide to move to git ... I think they are quite popular amongst git
</I>&gt;<i>   developers.
</I>
I have some stuff at gitorious.org.  It doesn't have a bug tracker
nor web page hosting (but you can have wiki pages) which rules it
out.


&gt;<i> * tuxfamily.org : This is currently my favourite... A very friendly
</I>&gt;<i>   hoster, I already have another project there (baller.tuxfamily.org)
</I>&gt;<i>   and made good experiences there so far.
</I>
Did you base your project on original baller sources?

I have cleaned up Baller sources here:
  <A HREF="http://koti.mbnet.fi/tammat/hatari/sources/baller-src.tar.gz">http://koti.mbnet.fi/tammat/hatari/sources/baller-src.tar.gz</A>

(I've ANSIfied the sources and fixed signedness &amp; int size etc issues)


&gt;<i>   Servers are located in Europe
</I>&gt;<i>   (==&gt; fast for most Hatari developers), they offer Mercurial
</I>&gt;<i>   repositories, mailing lists and webspace. Only drawback: We would
</I>&gt;<i>   need to install our own bugtracker at the website, there are no
</I>&gt;<i>   pre-installed bugtracking services.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think?
</I>
Tuxfamily looks very good, but it seems to live on donations:
	<A HREF="http://www.tuxfamily.org/en/support">http://www.tuxfamily.org/en/support</A>

I.e. it could get the same issue as BerliOS?
