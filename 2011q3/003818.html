Well, seems like you have a different user experience like me ... ;-)

Ok, maybe let me explain this issue from the beginning:

- Hatari always started the machine in &quot;warm reset&quot; mode since the
  beginning, it's a legacy from the WinSTon source code (so we
  certainly do not do this to offend EmuTOS). Maybe we could remove
  those memvalid hacks nowadays, but on the other side, why should
  we slow down the TOS boot process that way?

- The EmuTOS splashscreen has been once introduced by Petr, mainly
  for Aranym. However, there have always been some inconsistencies
  with it, e.g. autobooting Games that did not clear the screen
  initially clashed with the remainders of the splashscreen.

- The splashscreen also is of no real big use for the user, and
  occupies valuable space in the EmuTOS image, so for the 192 kB ROM
  images that I've built in the past, the splashscreen always had been
  disabled anyways.

- Some users also complained about the boot delay, and in the end
  even Petr changed the code, so that the splashscreen does not appear
  during a warm reset anymore.

So in my opinion it's rather welcome that the splashscreen does not
appear anymore on Hatari (even if it's just by accident right now), and
I think we should rather consider to remove it from EmuTOS completely.
(However, if you rather think that it should always appear again,
then simply revert the memvalid hack in EmuTOS again).


Concerning your crash with the Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Del, you're right, this
should certainly not crash and needs some investigation...
