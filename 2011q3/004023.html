</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; BerliOS will shut down at the end of December. So what's the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; alternative? Going back to Sourceforge?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Time for discussion!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; As we are using mercurial, bitbucket seems like a viable option.
</I>
BitBucket seems a little bit too commercial for me - e.g. they only
allow 5 users for the free repositories. That's not much.

&gt;<i> &gt; We can also use this as opportunity to move to git (which proved to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be more popular than hg).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anyhow, there is also google code, github, etc... Depends on the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; criteria for choosing.
</I>
I'd say, the top requirements are:

- Source code repository with a proper VCS (IMHO I would not use
  anything else beside Mercurial or git anymore).
- Webspace for our Hatari website
- Enough space for storing our release-tarballs
- Mailing list
- Bugtracker (could be handled via webspace also)

Apart from these top requirements, there are some other nice-to-have
features like forums, but since we hardly use them (and there are
alternatives like the Hatari forum on atari-forum.com instead), it's
not so important to have them.

So I think we can drop Google Code - since they do not provide webspace
for project, do they?

&gt;<i> if we were to use the most popular revision tool, I guess we would
</I>&gt;<i> use cvs or svn (if we only take into account the number of users /
</I>&gt;<i> projects using it).
</I>
Well, agreed, for the development style we use with Hatari, we could
also use a centralized VCS like SVN again, but IMHO the distributed
VCSes are really really better, e.g. because they also allow offline
development etc.
CVS is really a pain, and in SVN I don't like the branch and tag
handling, so I'd really say we stick with a distributed VCS instead ;-)

&gt;<i> I personnaly prefer to stay with mercurial, I don't see any point in 
</I>&gt;<i> using git over mercurial for our own development (which honnestly 
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't really make use of mercurial features that much in fact, we 
</I>&gt;<i> never really created branches or things like that to support several 
</I>&gt;<i> Hatari versions at a time).
</I>
I am using git a lot at work nowadays, and I have to say, it's really a
very powerful and good tool. When we moved away from CVS a couple of
years ago, there were some reasons to use mercurial instead:

- git is harder to learn, that still applies today, but now there are
  more people around who already know it

- there was hardly any git support for Windows users ... I think that
  has also changed a lot during the last years.

So IMHO we could also switch to git nowadays, but we don't really need
it for our development style, so we can also stick with Mercurial
instead.

&gt;<i> Let's see what hosting solutions we can find for mercurial, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> not sure sourceforge is the way to go (unless they really changed
</I>&gt;<i> their policy lately)
</I>
IIRC these were the main problems with SourceForge in the past:

- They disabled access to the raw CVS repository, you could only used
  checked-out versions of the files ==&gt; this does not apply anymore for
  distributed VCSes since you always get the full repository now.

- They did not offer modern VCS at that point in time, SVN support just
  started, but neither Mercurial or Git were available ==&gt; This has
  changed completely

- The servers became terribly slow, releasing a tarball was a pain
  ==&gt; As far as I know, they use faster servers now

- The website became very hard to use while they tried to renew the
  design and handling of the pages ==&gt; It's much better nowadays.

Most of the old pain points are vanished, so if we want to have an
&quot;easy&quot; solution (I mean, the old Hatari project is still registered
there), we should consider going back to SourceForge. 

Apart from SourceForge, I think these are good alternatives:

* www.nongnu.org : Uses pretty much the same web interface as berlios
  since both are derived from earlier versions of SourceForge, so we
  might feel at home there quite fast. Major drawback: They are very,
  very picky about the GNU philosophie, e.g. we would first need to
  replace Linux by GNU/Linux everywhere in our code and documentation,
  and IIRC they prohibit that a program links against a non-free
  library (which is not a problem for us yet, but we might need this
  one day for Pasti or one of the other disk image libraries).

* github.com or gitorious.org ... we should also consider those if we
  decide to move to git ... I think they are quite popular amongst git
  developers.

* tuxfamily.org : This is currently my favourite... A very friendly
  hoster, I already have another project there (baller.tuxfamily.org)
  and made good experiences there so far. Servers are located in Europe
  (==&gt; fast for most Hatari developers), they offer Mercurial
  repositories, mailing lists and webspace. Only drawback: We would
  need to install our own bugtracker at the website, there are no
  pre-installed bugtracking services.

What do you think?
