<PRE>Hi,


(I was now able to register to Atari forum (few years ago when I last
tried it, it didn't work) and to see the recording.)

On sunnuntai 31 hein&#228;kuu 2011, Nicolas Pomar&#232;de wrote:

</I>
Doesn't it?  Can you move the Hextracker mouse pointer to the lower part
of the screen in the windowed mode without grabbing the mouse (or installing
some Atari mouse accelerator, see below)?


&gt;<i> Is there a relation between the OS resolution and the mouse ?
</I>
HW-wise they're independent, but in med-rez there's more pixels to cover
on Atari side for the same amount of vertical mouse movements.  In GEM
the mouse at least seems to move across whole screen area vertically with
same amount of movement regardless of whether one uses low or med-rez.
Maybe GEM does some resolution dependent mouse movement scaling?

(Hatari also of course needs to compensate for its own screen zooming when
translating SDL events for host mouse movements to Atari mouse IKBD events.)


&gt;<i> Even if hextracker doesn't scale correctly, why does it work in
</I>&gt;<i> fullscreen ? Is this because the screen X/Y ratio has a certain value ?
</I>
The reason is that unless mouse is grabbed (like happens with AltGr+M
or fullscreen), the mouse moves outside of the Hatari window and therefore
Hextracker doesn't anymore get relative mouse movement events.  And when
Hextracker scales the movements wrong, you cannot move pointer to everywhere
on the screen before host mouse pointer moves out of the Hatari window.


&gt;<i> If so, can't we compensate delta X / delta Y in Hatari when we detect
</I>&gt;<i> the windowed resolution is not good ?
</I>
Only way to compensate for this Hextracker issue would be to make mouse
movement twice as slow for everything in med-rez.  I don't think
people would really appreciate it.

People typically install mouse accelerators to get faster mouse, I
don't understand why Hextracker specifically slows it down... :)

Note: you would get similar issue for any other mouse decelerator.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; How do you unlock the mouse if you accidentally lock it and don't know
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; how to unlock it?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mouse grab is disabled while emulation is paused, so just press Pause
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to pause emulation or F12 for options.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are no other Hatari AltGr shortcuts near the M key in normal
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; keyboard so it's unlikely that user accidentally presses this shortcut
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; though.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Well, he can still press it without thinking about an Hatari shortcut,
</I>&gt;<i> just by mistake.
</I>&gt;<i> But then, he can press F12 to quit from Hatari.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's hard to find a tradeoff when you grab all the keys/mouse event to
</I>&gt;<i> let the user exit this state.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But maybe we could add an indicator in the status bar when mouse is
</I>&gt;<i> locked?
</I>
There isn't enough space for a text message and if user doesn't know
he grabbed the mouse, how he would know that some indicator means that
mouse was grabbed?


&gt;<i> At least this would allow the user to know in which state
</I>&gt;<i> Hatari is.
</I>
I think this is a red herring.  During the last 8 years I've never
heard somebody to have grabbed mouse accidentally. :-)
