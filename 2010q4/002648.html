<PRE>Hi,

On Thursday 18 November 2010, Markus Fritze wrote:

</I>&gt;<i> leftovers from the old one).
</I>
Great, thanks!

Others can comment how nice it's to use, I'll comment on bit on things
in the code that might need improvement. :)

* &quot;written by&quot; -&gt; &quot;copyright by&quot;

* I don't think all pre-processors support '#' being anywhere else than
  at the start of the line (&quot;define&quot; can be indented though):
	#define MC68EC000	0x000002	// 16-/32-Bit Embedded Controller

* You should use TAB size of 8, e.g. this looks pretty broken:
---------
       long    addr;                           // address of the label
        Disass68kDataType       type;   // type of the data on the address
        int             size;                           // size of the 
label, references inside it are addressed via base address + offset
        int             count;                          // number of 
elements at this address with the given size
        int             structIndex;            // -1 no struct to describe 
the element
        char    *name;                          // name of the label
        char    *comment;                       // optional comment
} disSymbolEntry;
---------
  (trying to keep most things within 80 cols instead of putting several
   things on same line would be nice too.)

* Disass68k() is huge function, maybe you could consider splitting it to
  couple of subfunctions?

* As far as I could see, your code wasn't using/showing normal debugger
  symbols, nor profiler information.  Could that be added?


&gt;<i> If you want: add the symbol files from Symbols.zip to the .hatari folder
</I>&gt;<i> to get symbols (and more detailed ones for the TOS 3.06 and 4.04)
</I>
Those will be useful, but:

* I think the current debugger symbol code could be easily extended
   to support symbol size &amp; count and extra types, everything else except
   structures.

* Why OSX has separate binary versions of the symbols files?
  (and debugger code?)


&gt;<i> The disassembler can be fully configured via Diss68kOptions and
</I>&gt;<i> optionCPUTypeMask as well the TAB settings. Check the beginning of the
</I>&gt;<i> source. Somebody might want to add this to the preferences of Hatari.
</I>
I can do that later on.  Please add TODOs about those to suitable places in
your code. :-)


&gt;<i> The disassembler is able to deal with any 68k CPU (68000...68060, CPU32,
</I>&gt;<i> FPU and PMMU) and should detect illegal opcodes based on the CPU mask.
</I>
Is there a function to get next instruction address which _doesn't_ print
anything?


	- Eero

PS. As you have all the opcode tables, a potentially useful future addition
could be a function that search for given instruction subset from memory,
similarly to Monst...
