<PRE>Hi,

I forgot to mention that adding AES tracing would need (like DSP tracing)
changing the trace variable from 32- to 64-bit one as all bits are currently
needed.  I thought Laurent was doing that, but it seems I'll do it. :-)


Anyway, I was also thinking that now that:
-  the debugger can break into OS calls
- OS call opcode/name tables are already listed in the code for tracing

the debugger &quot;info&quot; command could also be used to list tables of the OS
(GEMDOS, BIOS, XBIOS, VDI, AES) call number/name pairs.  I don't want to add
the names for TAB-completion because they could conflict with the actual
function names.

This would mean that disabling tracing wouldn't get rid of these opcode/name
tables and code for listing them (currently it's built in only when tracing
is enabled when configuring Hatari).


For GEMDOS I was thinking that &quot;info gemdos&quot; could also show some Hatari
internal GEMDOS HDD emulation information like DTA contents etc.  (I could
also trivially make it so that giving non-zero argument to &quot;info gemdos&quot;
would select either opcode table or HDD emu state output)


Any objections on this?


	- Eero
