<PRE>Hello,

&gt;<i>  I tested quite a few and almost anything worked fine except for these:
</I>
Thanks for the tests.
If Thomas could tell us if this increases a bit DSP emulation for his 
slow computer, it would be nice.
Anyway, it must be better this way.

</I>&gt;<i>  the profile command, DSP loops here:
</I>
Can you send it to me ?

&gt;<i>  &quot;E.K.O system&quot; screen updates freeze after a while although
</I>&gt;<i>    music continues.
</I>

For EKO system, I already had some problems with this demo :
- I think it works better with 32 Mhz (we'll have to fix this bug one day).
- I've always had some bad sound distortion when the tridi ships are 
displayed, but sound is great again when there's no tridi.
   This can come from many explanations :
   - DSP cycles are not accurate enough
   - 68030 does a lot of muls, divs, movem or instructions that eat too 
much cycles (more cycles than the crossbar needs) (a bus cycle emulation 
will be necessary in this case). I suspect this problem occurs with many 
falcon emulated programs.
   - There's certainly one bug I still haven't found in the DSP code 
(for example in the _ demo).


&gt;<i>  * Lazer's Oergs gets stuck.
</I>
I'll have a look at this one.


For sound issues, I'm pretty sure this is because of cycles (As I 
explained just before).
For the Falcon, the time clock is given by the CPU, but the DSP and the 
crossbar (and the keyboard acia and the blitter) are independent.

The Crossbar needs precise cycles to run (for the sound) (sometimes 60 
cycles) and for data transfers between DSP and CPU.
But if the 68030 does a &gt; 60 cycles instruction, there's a problem.
And if the CPU does a &gt; 2*crossbar frequency (&gt; 120 cycles)  instruction 
(like divs or muls) we loose some sound and everything becomes 
unsynchronized.

At least, the DSP should give the clock to the whole computer, but the 
best would be to have an independent clock that would  send a signal 
every cycle. Each componant (CPU, DSP, Crossbar, Blitter, ...) would 
then wait the correct number of cycles before doing it's next 
instruction, independently of the CPU. (I think MAME works like this).


There's still some work for 2011 for the falcon emulation. ;)

Regards,

Laurent

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Btw. Now that I have more powerful machine, when I have sound enabled with
</I>&gt;<i> DSP emulation I can notice also sound issues (sound isn't anymore just
</I>&gt;<i> noise).
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> bad), like some underfed playback buffer would be looped by the HW.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> EKO's &quot;Are you experienced&quot; music is also very skippy although there would
</I>&gt;<i> seem to be enough CPU for Hatari (quarter of CPU is idle).
