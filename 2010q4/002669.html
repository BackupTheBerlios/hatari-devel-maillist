<PRE>Hi,

(I renamed the subject)

Hm, I just remembered that debugger has now a function for changing
the &quot;current&quot; dir which might confuse user if one doesn't remember that...?


&gt;<i> &gt; (Screenshot functionality would need a similar feature, there's a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; mention about it in the todo.txt file.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> it's true that depending on the current dir, it's not always easy to

</I>
When starting the recording from the UI instead of with shortcut, maybe it
would be better if it would give user a file selector with current dir
and &quot;hatari.avi&quot; name prefilled, so that user can change them if needed?


&gt;<i> Maybe we could create it in $HOME by default if there's no filepath ?
</I>
Or that path isn't writable for some reason...


&gt;<i> (do we have a function to get $HOME on windows ?)
</I>
The Paths_GetUserHome() from paths.c works is supposed to work also
for Windows.  If it doesn't find a suitable env variable, it uses current
directory.


&gt;<i> As you said, this should be applied to screenshot, but also to ym/wav
</I>&gt;<i> recording.
</I>
Right.


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Regarding the UI, if there's enough room, we could put a 'crop'
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; checkbox and an 'fps' box (auto or a number).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think the crop option should apply both to screenshots and to videos,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; so I moved it to [Screen] section and renamed the --avi-crop option
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; just to --crop.  See the attached patch.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Additionally I noticed some dead variables that aren't anymore used
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; after you added AVI recording so removed those too, both from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; screenshot code and the Screen.bCaptureChange in the configuration.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is that OK for everybody?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This looks ok to me, it makes sense to have cropping for screenshot too.
</I>
Ok, commited with a fix.
