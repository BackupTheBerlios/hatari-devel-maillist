<PRE>Hi,

I noticed a bug with Hatari's fire button while reading some atari-forum
posts. The Downfall game requires the fire button to be pressed to start
the game. If the button is pressed for more than one frame the game will
freeze, thus, the button must be tapped quickly. When the game goes to
the next round the button must be successfully tapped quickly again to
continue.

This problem existed with early versions of Steem and was solved.
Maybe Hatari could have this one looked at before the next version. :)

 Here is the story:

Downfall freezing up is actually a Steem bug, some silly keyboard controller
speed thing, we will sort it eventually. To get round it currently tap the
button as quickly as possible, if you still have problems then turn on slow
motion as you do it, that will guarantee the button will be held down for
only one frame.

In the game you can enable more of the options up the top by directing snow
into the channels at the side of your area.

OK, didn't know about the previous post. I should have searched for that.

I would have never guessed that that was the problem.

I tried and have successfully entered  the game with the tapping trick, some
times know. But you usually don't make it after the first time, so you'll
have to reboot several times to get the timing right for the tapping.
Next problem is the game consists of rounds, so when one player has won the
first round and you're on to next round, if you don't time the tapping right,
the game will again freeze. So I don't think it works fine in Hatari, but it
can work as long as your good with the tapping.

Thanks, for all the help.
