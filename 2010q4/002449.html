<PRE>Hi,


&gt;<i> So I think GEMDOS emulation is better solution.  You can check Hatari's
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>your arguments are very good, I tend to agree with you now.

I meant that the OS needs to boot before program can be run.
&gt;<i> Programs may need OS services (e.g. GEM) to work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sure, TOS would be needed, that's no question. GEM -- yeah, that's a
problem. But for a GEM stuff, one can use Aranym with far better chances for
easy development.

I was thinking that if Hatari could create the INF file virtually, then
&gt;<i> the program could be in a read-only directory, e.g. on CD.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Yes, this respects my wish of not bothering user with some crappy
DESKTOP.INF file, as it's created virtually. With this feature, I mark this
feature request as perfectly done ;) You can do it as following: take
current emulated GEMDOS HDD, look for desktop.inf/newdesk.inf, if present,
do nothing (or make it optional, what to do). If not present, look for
command line argument if there isn't something to run, if so, create virtual
inf file and slide it to GEMDOS HDD. Shouldn't be so hard or?

Hatari package for Linux distros could then even register a Linux
&gt;<i> binfmt_misc handler that invokes Hatari automatically when one clicks on
</I>&gt;<i> an Atari binary.  (Like some people have done with Wine and Window programs
</I>&gt;<i> or Java VM and Java programs.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Holy crap, this would be awesome !!!

&gt;<i> This isn't that critical. Can be added later, if needed at all.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It might be nice for the cases when the messages disappear too fast to read
</I>&gt;<i> them.  Unfortunately it seems that e.g. EmuTOS messages cannot be catched
</I>&gt;<i> this way[1].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I meant, this particular feature of re-interpreting escape codes isn't that
critical, the feature as whole is something I miss badly ;-) I don't care
about OS stuff (one can use much better techniques provided by excellent
Hatari debugger), this is about application level, it's so boring to
implement &quot;press a key to exit&quot; for TOS programs, prey text will fit into
console size and wont scroll away etc... (esp. for demos where graphics,
i.e. non-console screen is used I have no other options for logs than
postponed screen output of files, what is quite inconvenient).
