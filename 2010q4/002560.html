<PRE>Hi,

On Friday 22 October 2010, Laurent Sallafranque wrote:
&gt;&gt;<i> * Is WinUAE CPU actually using C++ exceptions (it had try, throw&amp;

</I>
I didn't read the code so carefully, are they using something that's C, but
looks like C++, or actually using C++ exceptions (like it seemed)?

Because if they're using real exceptions, I think they can happen in any of
the called functionality within the try block and/or be catched at some
higher level (if current level doesn't catch some particular exception). 
I.e. getting that stuff right could be a bit trickier.

Well, if you got all try/throw/catch already converted, it wasn't an
overwhelming amount of places and can hopefully reviewed properly later once
the new CPU core actually works to some extent... :)


&gt;<i> &gt; * What's the problem with the large number of &quot;L&quot; changes, couldn't
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they be handled with some single define (&quot;#define L&quot;) in compat header?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; -      D(bug(L&quot;MMU: map transparent mapping of %08x\n&quot;, *ttr)); +     
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; //D(bug(L&quot;MMU: map transparent mapping of %08x\n&quot;, *ttr));
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, I think this would generate problems with lines of code like this one
</I>&gt;<i> :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> readcpu.c:    { i_ASL, &quot;ASL&quot;  , &quot;&quot;},
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;ASL&quot; would become &quot;AS&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Correct me if I'm wrong.
</I>
I think C pre-processor defines should be smarter (otherwise it we could
replace cpp with sed), and only replace whole C-syntax identifiers, not
arbitrary parts of them...

(You could try it and check the pre-processor output.)


&gt;<i> &gt; * cpu/custom.h - does that contain anything that would really be needed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     by CPU emulation code?  If not, I guess it could be replaced just
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; with an empty file with comment saying that it's there just to reduce
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; changes to WinAUE sources.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK for this, but I think in this case that I should also include the
</I>&gt;<i> whole .h (empty) files from uae that are needed for compiling (I've
</I>&gt;<i> commented some of them).
</I>
I was mainly wondering whether the whole file is redundant and not just
the commented out parts.


&gt;<i> At opposite, if you don't mind, I can just comment the lines that
</I>&gt;<i> contains .h includes we don't need.
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think it would be a huge work to comment  them again after a
</I>&gt;<i> major update.
</I>
Fine with me. :-)


&gt;<i> &gt; * If you take some file directly from uae-cpu/, it would be preferably
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if it could be a separate commit from other winuae code modifications.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Such file could, at least eventually, be in some directory common to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; both AUE&amp;  WinUAE code (at least maccess.h changes looked like this)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You both have answered to this.
</I>&gt;<i> So, should I keep the actual way of doing it or should I apply your
</I>&gt;<i> above suggestion ?
</I>
If you could in future commit separately things that are taken from Hatari
AUE code as-is and things that are other changes to WinAUE code, that would
be nice.  It helps understanding the changes a bit more.


&gt;<i> &gt; * cpu/sysconfig.h:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - AUE configuration things are OK
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - system configuration defines (like STDC_HEADERS) shouldn't be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;      WinAUE specific, but be created by CMake, otherwise they will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wrong
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Eero, could you take some time to help me on this special file.
</I>&gt;<i> I'm not the best one for system configuration defines.
</I>
I'm not that familiar with that side of CMake either...

&gt;<i> If you could make the necessary changes in sysconfig.h file, this would
</I>&gt;<i> be great.
</I>
But it seems that Hatari's system configuration comes from
cmake/config-cmake.h and after configuring things with CMake
the configuration is written to config.h in the Hatari root dir.

Some of the defines used in sysconfig.h are things that in Hatari come from
other places too, for example path separator comes from main.h (which
includes config.h).


First you could move things that aren't used anywhere to some other file
(for reference).  I wrote a helper script to investigate this.  Run the
attached script in cpu/ dir like this:
	find-defines.sh sysconfig.h *.[ch]

And it will tell which defines aren't used (a lot of them), and in which
files the ones that are used are actually used.

After re/moving those away, you could split the things that are related to
system instead of to WinAUE configuration also into a separate file and for
now just include it from sysconfig.h.   I, Thomas or Nicolas could then at
some later point look how to integrate system stuff there with CMake &amp;
config-cmake.h.


&gt;&gt;<i> * cpu/cpummu.c - why remove &quot;static&quot;?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> -static struct mmu_atc_line atc_l2[2][ATC_L2_SIZE];
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> +struct mmu_atc_line atc_l2[2][ATC_L2_SIZE];
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If I remove static, I get the following error :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> /home/laurent/Atari/hatari/src/cpu/cpummu.c:45: error: static
</I>&gt;<i> declaration of &#8216;atc_l2&#8217; follows non-static declaration
</I>&gt;<i> /home/laurent/Atari/hatari/src/cpu/cpummu.h:238: note: previous
</I>&gt;<i> declaration of &#8216;atc_l2&#8217; was here
</I>&gt;<i> /home/laurent/Atari/hatari/src/cpu/cpummu.c:253: warning: no previous
</I>&gt;<i> prototype for &#8216;mmu_dump_atc&#8217;
</I>
You can remove it from the header, it's used only in cpummu.c file.
