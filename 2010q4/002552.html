<PRE>Hi,

Yes.  I wasn't sure which one you were asking for. :-)


&gt;<i> I think the correst &quot;step&quot; command should be the one that breaks 1568

</I>
Do you think &quot;c 1&quot; really needs a shortcut?


&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;    - you can have a more elaborate step instruction that breaks after
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; opcodes that changes PC by jumping elsewhere. This is handy to execute
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; a sub routine / trap handler as a whole, without going step by step in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; the routine.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is the longest such instruction shorter than shortest such instruction?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ?? Sorry, I don't understand what is &quot;such instruction&quot; ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If yes, then a shortcut for this is enough:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	b pc&gt;  &quot;pc&quot;&amp;&amp;  pc&lt;  &quot;pc&lt;maxlen + 1&gt;&quot; :once
</I>
This would would also need special case for rt[drs] instructions where
it would do just:
	pc ! &quot;pc&quot; :once


&gt;<i> what is maxlen ? If it's the maximum size of a branch instruction, then
</I>&gt;<i> it won't work the way you propose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> jsr $123456.l will take 6 bytes
</I>&gt;<i> trap / bsr.s will take 2 bytes
</I>
Ok, so it will really need to know the instruction length.

-&gt; Will need to wait Markus' code and it (hopefully) providing
    a function for this...

I guess breakpoints will then also need some flag to silence the normal
output from breakpoint matching as that could be annoying. :-)


&gt;<i> &gt; I quickly looked at these values but they didn't seem to match the next
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; instruction address so I guess I was doing something wrong.  How you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would get that value in Hatari C-code?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Have a look at m68k_do_rts in cpuemu.h :
</I>&gt;<i> m68k_setpc(get_long(m68k_areg(regs, 7)));
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> so get_long(m68k_areg(regs, 7)) is what you need to return from a non
</I>&gt;<i> exception branch (for exceptions, return pc is at 2(a7), so
</I>&gt;<i> get_long(m68k_areg(regs, 7)+2) will do the trick)
</I>
On the Hatari side that should be:
	STMemory_ReadLong(Regs[REG_A7]+2)

Which I've already tried.  However, it doesn't give the same value as what
the UAE disassembly function gives as next value.

When there's a VDI exception, I get:
next PC: $fe5bcc
(sp): $fe1f1a
2(sp): $1f1a000c

And for Bios exceptions which have the opcode in stack, I get (for example):
next PC: $fc9260
(sp): $70000
2(sp): $0

Debugger is called at the end of newcpu.c::do_specialties() which seems
to happen before the exception handling in AUE core.  At this point D0
is at least OK, but could it affect what's on the stack?
