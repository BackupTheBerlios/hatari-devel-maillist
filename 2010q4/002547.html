<PRE>Hi,

Using disasm didn't work very well because in some cases it can
constantly output stuff on traps (for which one currently doesn't
have matching breakpoints or isn't otherwise interested).

I looked into modifying UAE CPU disassembly code to avoid this, but it was
printing things in several places, so I though to wait for Markus'
disassembly code and hope that it would have a separate function for asking
about next PC address.

Markus, could you post your code?


&gt;<i> By 
</I>&gt;<i> using this method, you can have a more &quot;intelligent&quot; step function for
</I>&gt;<i> the debugger (as available under monst for instance) :
</I>&gt;<i>   - you can have a simple step instruction that breaks each time PC is
</I>&gt;<i> changed
</I>
Do you mean shortcut for:
	b pc ! &quot;pc&quot; :once
or for:
	c 1
debugger command?


&gt;<i>   - you can have a more elaborate step instruction that breaks after
</I>&gt;<i> opcodes that changes PC by jumping elsewhere. This is handy to execute a
</I>&gt;<i> sub routine / trap handler as a whole, without going step by step in the
</I>&gt;<i> routine.
</I>
Is the longest such instruction shorter than shortest such instruction?

If yes, then a shortcut for this is enough:
	b pc &gt; &quot;pc&quot; &amp;&amp; pc &lt; &quot;pc &lt;maxlen + 1&gt;&quot; :once


&gt;<i> Some disassembler used &quot;s&quot; and &quot;z&quot; shortcuts (or &quot;t&quot; for trace) to
</I>&gt;<i> differenciate these 2 behaviours.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Note that Vincent's idea of getting the return from 2(sp) is also a
</I>&gt;<i> valid one ; but to intercept any kind of branch opcodes you need to get
</I>&gt;<i> return pc from 2(a7) if this in an exception handler (trap, ...) or from
</I>&gt;<i> (a7) if this is a &quot;normal&quot; branch (bsr, jsr, ...), so slighlty more
</I>&gt;<i> cases to handle)
</I>
I quickly looked at these values but they didn't seem to match the next
instruction address so I guess I was doing something wrong.  How you
would get that value in Hatari C-code?
