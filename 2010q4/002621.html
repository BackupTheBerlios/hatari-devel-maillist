Hatari has support for automatic memory snapshot which can help a little.
After enabling that, you can just quit and give Hatari the same automatic
memory snapshot filename as you gave for previous AVI recording.

</I>
I'd say that showing timer in UI for normal users would require it to be in
minutes/seconds, not VBLs.   AVI uses fixed FPS (which user can also
specify) so it would be possible to calculate the time.  AVI recording
would need to get &amp; store at which VBL it started.


There's no space in statusbar for extra information, but it might be done
as &quot;messages&quot;.  However, downside is that messages have timeouts which
correspond to host timing and they're queued.  Showing recording timings in
emulated time as messages would either mean that time info is delayed, or it
disappearing when Hatari emulation runs slower than host time.  Not very
good.


Updating titlebar can be a bit heavy with some window managers, so it would
need to be at a bit longer intervals, maybe every 2 or 5 seconds?


&gt;<i> Also it seems strange to me that --run-vbls and --avi-crop are hidden 
</I>&gt;<i> from the GUI.
</I>
For --run-vbls there wouldn't have been any point.  As I stated in my mail
on Friday, --run-vbls didn't earlier have any affect if given after Hatari
boot.  (I added it originally to get better performance numbers for Hatari
code changes for stuff in memory snapshots.)


As to AVI options, they don't seem be yet even in the Hatari configuration.
The UI includes only options that are in the Hatari configuration.

Nicolas, could you move the AviRecordFile, AviRecordDefaultCrop,
nScreenRefreshRate, AviRecordDefaultVcodec to the configuration,
maybe under new [Video]&#160;section?


After that there could be checkbox for cropping in the UI as SDL Screen
dialog still seems to have little space for it.

OSX UI of course cannot be updated by any of the Hatari developers as we
don't have XCode (Thomas has OSX, but AFAIK his XCode is too old to work
with current Hatari OSX code).

For the Python UI I haven't yet had time to add to even some more common
earlier/options (which actually have been requested earlier).  But once AVI
is in configuration I can add the needed support.
