<PRE>Hi,

I think there's are some things to fix before the options :


First, the GUI :

- I think it shouldn't be possible to select atari ST and still have DSP options
selectable (the same for many parameters, like memory, blitter, ...).

- choosing a computer should set and disable some parameters automatically +
should disable some choice (ST and DSP or 14 Meg memory for example).

- from the new core, MMU seems to be only usable with 68040(I'll try to let it
run with a 68030 to see if this can work).

- idem, I've commented an option in newcpu.c (they disabled the possibility to
use better emulation with 24 bit memory).

We need to stabilize completly the new core, see how we use it, and next, adapt
the GUI and the option line.


Second, the MMU :

- before my hollidays, I did some changes to Hatari concerning MMU. It worked
better, but not well. When I launched raimbow2 multimedia (it uses MMU), I had a
illegal instruction on 4e7a (but this instruction is known in cpu31.c)

I'll have to trace and debug this to let the MMU work (maybe the try/catch is
guilty)


Third, the &quot;cpu change on the fly bug) :

With the new core, if I select in the GUI that I want to swap from a 68030 to a
68040+MMU, the new CPU isn't taken into account.
In this case, I was running in _run_2p and I whould have swapped to run_040mmu

I remenber I had removed a parameter in the main loop of all the _run functions
in newcpu.c (something like SPECIAL_MODE or SPECIAL_FLAG).
With it, hatari never started. But I think my patch was wrong, it should be
reintegrated and try to see from where the real problem was. (I'll check this
next week).


Fourth : Videl :

I'll have a look at it after having fixed the precedent problems.

Regards

Laurent

</I>&gt;<i>   but on earlier CPU models it's a separate chip.
</I>&gt;<i> - If addressing mode setting is needed, it could be under System I guess.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (After that System section would have quite a lot of options, but I think

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Btw. The reason why starting editing WinAUE options was that they were

</I>&gt;<i> PS. Has anybody tested the new --desktop (Falcon/TT specific) option yet?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If your monitor / LCD is very slow at the resolution switches, it should

</I>&gt;<i> [1] Black screen where only mouse worked fine despite killing Hatari from

</I>&gt;<i>
