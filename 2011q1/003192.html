<PRE>Le 20/03/2011 21:25, Eero Tamminen a &#233;crit :

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - F15 Strike Eagle 2 (I'd remove this if nobody can test it)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I think Thomas committed some fix for this some times ago.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any idea to which version of Hatari?
</I>
Could be rev 1979, so I would say 1.3.0

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> - DevPac 2.2 Monst (crashy)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Never crashed for me ; since Hatari now handles some complex 68000
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> protections using stacks/exceptions/... I think we can remove this one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK.  Any idea when did it start to work / what's the earliest version of
</I>&gt;<i> Hatari in which you remember it working fine?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder was this something similar to issue Pure debugger apparently had
</I>&gt;<i> with the Gemdos emulation which was fixed for v1.4?
</I>
I don't think it was similar. For me, MonST never crashed, so I would 
say at least 1.2.0

&gt;&gt;<i> Someone should test this, but I don't think it's still valid.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Me neither.  I tested quickly Neochrome master in some earlier Hatari
</I>&gt;<i> version and didn't see anything, but without knowing what was the initial
</I>&gt;<i> issue, it's hard to say anything about it.
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt;  Maybe set the version to v1.3 where you did lot of video fixes...
</I>
Yes, it's certainly the case, some stabilities were gained for non 
spec512 mode in 1.3.0.


&gt;<i> README could also state that we hope to have the WinAUE core as default
</I>&gt;<i> in next Hatari release, but old AUE could still be (configured and) used if
</I>&gt;<i> speed is an issue.
</I>
UAE not AUE :)
