<PRE>Hi,

Well, it was a bit hard to believe that there's a system that's still being
developed for but which has this obsolete version of SDL that nobody's
even interested to update.

Even Atari has a newer version:

Are you really sure GP2X doesn't have a newer libsdl?


&gt;<i> What is so difficult to think about backward compatibility or making
</I>&gt;<i> code parts OPTIONAL at compile time?
</I>
I checked what SDL versions all Linux distros ship before adding the 
functionality needed by Laurent (limiting Hatari window to Desktop size
so that it doesn't crash his X server) and Anders (not changing resolution
as it messes his OSX virtual desktops).

Only distros where one could still find that old version of SDL is
the commercial RedHat Enterprise Linux v4 (+ its commercial Oracle &amp;
free CentOS derivatives) that was released on 2005:
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux#Life_Cycle_Dates">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux#Life_Cycle_Dates</A>

None of the currently available Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, SUSE, Mandriva etc
distro versions (e.g. Debian oldstable) have it anymore available and of
course any RHEL distro where new Hatari version would be included will have
new enough SDL version.


&gt;<i> Stop applying the Java &quot;no code has to be optional&quot; approach to portable
</I>&gt;<i> C sources!
</I>
As I don't have that obsolete SDL version, I cannot test functionality
for it.

If you want Hatari to have support for SDL versions that nobody else has
ready access to, you're the one that needs to support them and test that
this support works.  If that support is really needed and can be added
cleanly to Hatari, there isn't a problem.

According to your comments the code &amp; documentation part should look
something like the attached patch.  SDL seems to have macro for checking
for SDL version, so it might be possible that it doesn't need changes to
CMake.

PS. The new SDL requirement is not the only thing that had changed in Hatari
since v1.4, Thomas for example removed the support for Autotools &amp; plain
Makefiles (about which I complained a bit at the time :)).
