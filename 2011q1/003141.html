<PRE>Le 02/03/2011 21:26, Eero Tamminen a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I commited the --desktop option and splitting of the display options
</I>&gt;<i> under different headings.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> Moving them under their own heading + having pre-liminary documentation
</I>&gt;<i> in manual page shouldn't hurt as long as both will eventually be fixed...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (I think it's official only when it goes to manual.html as updating that is
</I>&gt;<i> more annoying due to the required ugly HTML tables. :))
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
&gt;<i> What if I would pre-liminarily change --cpu-exact to --cycle-exact?
</I>
Regarding cpu options, I think we should really first have a working 
support, see what modifications it took to get there and then update/add 
manuals accordingly.

There's no need in rushing on doc for now, we don't know which cpu mode 
will remain in Hatari and how they might be customised to our use ; it 
will be the icing on the cake once everything else is working.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And what if I would also shorten the --sound-buffer-size option to
</I>&gt;<i> --sound-buffer?  Currently it and its description doesn't fit to 80 columns.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (Unfortunately --sound-buffer-size was already in v1.4.0 release so it would
</I>&gt;<i> be an API change.  I don't think it widely used though, anybody needing it
</I>&gt;<i> should have set it to config file&amp;  forgotten about it. :-))
</I>
I don't like the idea of changing existing options ; also 
&quot;--sound-buffer&quot; alone doesn't necessarily imply &quot;size&quot;, it could me 
mono/stereo, or buffered versus unbuffered ?

Maybe it would be better to add a CR/LF in the description of 
--sound-buffer-size to have it on 2 lines ? (some options are already 
using 2 lines).

As for the historical 80 columns convention, I'm not sure it really 
applies nowaday. Do all terminals under kde/gnome/os x/... really open 
with 80 columns by default ? Is it really such a problem if lines are 
wider than 80 columns ?
In my case (and I think many people are doing the same), when I 
regularly use terminals, I always widen the window, 80 columns is just 
too short.

Best would be to have something similar to &quot;man&quot; where the text adapts 
to the width of the current shell (keeping indentation and so on), but 
that's kinda out of the scope of Hatari anyway.
