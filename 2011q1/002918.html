I tried few things with the UAE (not WinUAE) core.

Sidplay is still silent and falcamp still gets DSP timeout.

Gemplay sounds now OK with GT2 song, AON one has horrible noise in
the background, AM one is silent.


FlexTrax gets now DSP stack overflow on startup and freezes.
Strange thing is that it does the freeze (but no overflow) also
with Hatari v1.4.  It worked with Hatari v1.3 (except for sound).


AceTracker sounds are still bad, I guess that's related to DSP/CPU
communication as it complains about &quot;CPU overload&quot; and says it reseted
DSP while it's trying to play a song.  Does it work any better with WinAUE?


With AceMidi demo, after loading a bank of sounds and pressing some keys
to hear how they sound, the sounds are better than earlier (depends on
which sounds I select).

However, when I switched Hatari sound frequency from 44.1kHz to 48kHz,
the program immediately crashed...  When I tried again and switched Hatari
from 48Khz to 44.1kHz, the program also crashed, but it took maybe a second
or two.

While writing this mail, I suddenly got sound in the speakers and this
notice from Hatari (which was running on background after the program
crashed):
crossbar DMA Play: Illegal buffer size (from 0x172900 to 0x072900)

I think there may be something funny in relation to Crossbar and sound
frequency changing.
