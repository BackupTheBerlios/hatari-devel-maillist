<PRE>Hi,

Ok, I'll leave the option names as-is and don't add WinAUE options to manual
page.  However, the question I had was about the options grouping though.

I was thinking that WinAUE specific options could be under their own
heading, at least until it's more clear what they are and is the next
release going to be using just WinAUE CPU core or also old UAE one.

If they aren't under separate heading:
- the MMU option should go under CPU as MMU is part of that.
- FPU could be under either CPU or System as in 040 FPU is part of the CPU,
  but on earlier CPU models it's a separate chip.
- If addressing mode setting is needed, it could be under System I guess.

(After that System section would have quite a lot of options, but I think
keymap option would belong better under generic options.)


Btw. The reason why starting editing WinAUE options was that they were
slightly broken.  They specified &quot;bool&quot; instead of &quot;&lt;bool&gt;&quot; (i.e. error
handling for non- bool input values wouldn't work properly) and every option
had explanation for what are the possible values for a bool option, although
that's explained at the end of the Hatari usage output. :-)

PS. Has anybody tested the new --desktop (Falcon/TT specific) option yet?

If your monitor / LCD is very slow at the resolution switches, it should
give more pleasant Falcon experience with demos that change the resolution
often.  I would just like to know does it work properly for everyone or has
somebody encountered the problem I encountered once[1].  If yes, does that
happen also for OSX or Windows...?

[1] Black screen where only mouse worked fine despite killing Hatari from
another console.  Getting rid of that issue requires X server &amp; X session
restart.

It seems like bug in my Linux desktop/X/Intel gfx driver. App that has been
killed, that doesn't change resolution nor use 3D (which would bypasses X), 
shouldn't be able to do something like that.
