</I>
The point of it is not to get accurate wallclock, but to get process time
(which Linux times() provides to user-space at 100Hz tick which isn't
accurate for very short intervals) as that's not affected by other processes
and is therefore more accurate measure of how much CPU time is spent by that
_particular_ process _over time_, not how the clock advance in the whole
system.


&gt;<i> Could you replace calls to Main_GetTicks by SDL_GetTicks and remove the
</I>&gt;<i> function if you have no opposition to this ?
</I>
That function already falls back to SDL_GetTicks() if times() isn't
available, but using wallclock would really need you to run Hatari from some
kind of bootup console so that other processes aren't working on background
(no network etc) for results to be even remotely useful.


If e.g. CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID clock for POSIX clock_gettime() function
is about similar process specific time accounting as times(), it could be
used to get higher resolution than with times().


&gt;<i> Also, looking at the debug print you added to measure fast forward, they
</I>&gt;<i> only appear in the console when doing a pause, is this intented ?
</I>
Yes.  It's supposed to measure time spent by _Hatari process_ between
specific points.  It printing the stuff at pause is a bit of a convenience,
mainly you're supposed to use it with --run-vbls after loading a suitable
memory snapshot.

Unless you're specifically measuring screen output speed, you should
also set frame skip to same value as --run-vbls (and disable sound),
otherwise screen updates can mess the measurements a bit.


&gt;<i> For example, press alt+x several times to go normal/fast mode : nothing
</I>&gt;<i> is printed. Then press 'pause' and SPEED line is printed.
</I>&gt;<i> Press alt+x again several times and nothing is printed until you press
</I>&gt;<i> pause again.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is this the intended behaviour to print these stats only when doing
</I>&gt;<i> pause?
</I>
Yes, and of course only when you're running at full speed so that CPU
keeps at full speed, CPU isn't waste looping in main.c on more exact timings
etc.

The pause output is most useful if you have also an Atari test-case that
really repeats same thing over and over.  Just let the repeating use-case
run long enough that it doesn't matter so much at which point do pause
and then check how many VBLs Hatari got during that time.

E.g. most Falcon DSP demos have wildly differing usage patterns in
their screens and the screens don't look foorever.  Therefore they aren't
suitable for using for measuring.
