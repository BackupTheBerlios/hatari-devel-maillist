These don't need to be set in the system default configuration, one can have
a separate configuration file that contains only the options that you want
to override from the default config.  You can specify your own config with
--configfile option.


If you want to send Hatari commands or change its configuration while it's
running, you can send them using Hatari's command socket, specified with
the --control-socket option.  Try hconsole.py to see how that works.


The latest (not yet released) version of Hatari has also support (hack) for
running programs directly with Hatari just with &quot;hatari dir/some.prg&quot;.
Almost any program that doesn't need to  be run from the auto/ -folder seems
to be working fine with it.

Related to this, there's also tools/hatari-tos-register.sh init script you
can use to register Hatari as a handler for Atari programs.  After running
that you can start Atari programs directly from your Linux desktop.
This of course assumes that Hatari's configured for the Atari type
(ST/STE/TT/Falcon) that the Atari program that you clicked expects,
but if you know what you do, you can get around that too.


Finally, if you want to embed Hatari window inside Arcade launcher UI,
see the hatariui.py for PyGtk code on how to do it using Gtk Plug/Socket
widget and hatari.py for what environment variable you need to set for
Hatari to embed itself into your program.

Note: The embedding is done in a slightly unorthodoxly as embedding support
is slightly broken in both SDL and Gtk.  SDL's own embedding support
disables keyboard input (as can be verified from SDL sources), so embedding
support is built directly into Hatari itself.  And Gtk steals keys from the
embedded window unless you disable that in the surrounding Gtk widgets
(= you cannot have keyboard shortcuts in your own program if you want keys
to work in the embedded program).  That happens at least for embedded
programs that don't implement full XEmbed protocol...
