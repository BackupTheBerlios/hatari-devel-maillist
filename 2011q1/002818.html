<PRE>Le 16/01/2011 13:42, Laurent Sallafranque a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> I added the +1 to have the demo &quot;ROT3DBMP.PRG&quot; or &quot;BOUND3.PRG&quot; run.
</I>&gt;<i> (probably some other programs, but I don't remember).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This +1 is really &quot;the limit&quot; to let these programs run correctly or not.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've already tested some things without it, but it seems to be needed to
</I>&gt;<i> work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree it should not be there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Perhaps DSP timings (cycles) are still not perfect, but I've done many
</I>&gt;<i> tests with them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I know that there can be differences in DSP cycles with interrupts, but
</I>&gt;<i> to be completely perfect, we should had a 3 instructions pipeline in the
</I>&gt;<i> DSP.
</I>&gt;<i> Until now, I haven't had to code this pipeline (I simulate it in DSP
</I>&gt;<i> interrupts, and I take the extra cycles in account, according to the
</I>&gt;<i> Motorola DSP documentation).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe the problem is not there anyway. (There's still this 32Mhz problem
</I>&gt;<i> with EKO_System demo that may explain some things).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another try I tested without success : the Host Interface (DSP &lt;--&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 68030 exchanges on portB) is running at 8 Mhz, not 32. I've tested this
</I>&gt;<i> last week, but I didn't noticed any change.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Your &quot;new look&quot; on this problem is really welcome.

I spent more time on this, and I found several explanationq to the 
problems we have now in falcon mode :

  1) DSP_Run doesn't compute the correct number of cycles allowed to the 
DSP (using the number of cpu cycles)

  2) All intructions timings are those of a 68000, not a 68030


More precisely, on the 1st point &quot;cycles = nHostCycles * ( DSP_FREQ / 
CPU_FREQ ) - save_cycles + 1;&quot; really looks wrong to me, on a real 
hardware we just have a DSP running twice as fast as the CPU (32 Mhz vs 
16 Mhz).
The 1st problem is that DSP_FREQ / CPU_FREQ = 4 (because CPU_FREQ is 8 
Mhz for a STF), so this give twice too much cycles to the dsp (*4 
instead of *2) because in the case of the falcon the cpu is at 16 Mhz, 
not 8.
The 2nd problem as reported in my previous mail is that save_cycles is 
&lt;=0, so we should do a &quot;+ save_cycles&quot;, not a &quot;- save_cycles&quot; to 
compensate the fact that the DSP took a few more cycles that allowed 
during the previous call to DSP_Run.

In the end, I think a more correct way for DSP_Run should be :

void DSP_Run(int nHostCycles)
{
#if ENABLE_DSP_EMU
         save_cycles += nHostCycles * 2;

         if (dsp_core.running == 0)
                 return;

         if (save_cycles &lt;= 0)
                 return;

         if (unlikely(bDspDebugging)) {
                 while (save_cycles &gt; 0)
                 {
                         DebugDsp_Check();
                         dsp56k_execute_instruction();
                         save_cycles -= dsp_core.instr_cycle;
                 }
         } else {
                 while (save_cycles &gt; 0)
                 {
                         dsp56k_execute_instruction();
                         save_cycles -= dsp_core.instr_cycle;
                 }
         }

#endif
}

This function calls dsp56k_execute_instruction as long as save_cycles is 
 &gt;0. When save_cycles becomes &lt;0 (which means the DSP is &quot;ahead&quot; of the 
CPU), we wait until it becomes &gt;0 again by adding nHostCycles*2

For this the falcon mode should be used with a 16 Mz cpu (not 32 as in 
Eko System, but see below for others problems related to cpu freq)

I made some tests with this function and eko system is worse than before 
; I think it's because some others parts of the falcon were adapted to 
give correct results with the current DSP_Run function (which is wrong). 
If we correct DSP_Run, we must correct the other parts too.


For the 2nd point, regarding 68030 cycles, Hatari uae's core only knows 
68000 cycles. We can emulate a 16 or 32 Mhz CPU by dividing cycles by 2 
or 4 (this is not how it's done in a real Atari, but it allows to 
emulate a faster freq). The problem is that we're emulating a falcon 
with a 68000 at 16 Mhz ! As long as there's no interaction with strong 
synchronisation requirement between dsp and cpu, it's ok, we don't 
really need precise cycles ; but if we want to execute the exact amount 
of cycles in the DSP for a given 68030 instruction, then it won't work, 
as seen in more advanced demos.

For example, take a NOP. It's 4 cycles on 68000 and 68030, so the DSP 
should have 8 cycles to run. But with current DSP_Run you would get 
(4/2)*4 = 8 cycles at 16 Mhz and (4/4)*4 = 4 cycles at 32 Mhz.
With the DSP_Run above, you would get (4/2)*2=4 cycles at 16 Mhz and 
(4/4)*2 = 2 cycles at 32 Mhz ! Only the 1st one is correct, but it's 
just because we're lucky and the NOP has the same timing on 68000 and 68030.

If we consider a MOVE that takes 20 cycles on 68000, it could take 12 
cycles on 68030 (depends on size, ...), so DSP cycles would be wrong in 
all cases.
Even worse for a MUL : it can be 56 cycles on 68000 but 12 cycles on 
68030 (it's much faster). As we use 68000 timings for the DSP, this 
means we will really give too much cycles to the DSP (4 times too much !).

By running eko system with a 32 Mhz CPU, you just use another 
approximation that says 68030_cycles = 68000_cycles / 4. Depending on 
the demo code, this approximation can give better results (but there's 
no rule, 68030 cycles will often be between /2 and /4 when compared to a 
68000, but could be even different)

As you see, we're now to a point where DSP&lt;-&gt;CPU exact sync can not be 
improved without proper 68030 timings.

This is similar to the problem I had when I wanted to improve border 
removal emulation on STF : uae's core was not precise enough to give the 
correct write cycle. It was possible to remove top/bottom borders that 
don't require too much precision, but emulating complex hardscroll on 
STF was impossible.


Now, what can we do to improve this :

- I'm not using falcon a lot, so I don't know a lot of demos and whether 
they use DSP or not ; could some people try their favorite DSP demos 
with the new DSP_Run function above ? Maybe this will improve some demo, 
maybe not, but I'm rather confident that is the base to use and we 
should adapt the rest of the falcon mode to work again with this new 
DSP_Run.

- We need to improve/use the WinUae's core : it has correct timings for 
68020+, so we will be able to get the correct number of cycles to be 
allocated to DSP_Run on each call. With uae's core, we will do 
approximation that will fix some demos and break some others, but it's 
unlikely to work everytime in the end.

- We can still fix bugs in the DSP when we see them, we're stuck for now 
to improve DSP/CPU sync, but we can still optimize the DSP itself for 
example.


Well, I hope it's not too depressing for those that expected a better 
Falcon mode soon, but at least I think that by better understanding the 
causes of the current problems we will be able to build a more 
robust/faithful emulation.

Regards

Nicolas
