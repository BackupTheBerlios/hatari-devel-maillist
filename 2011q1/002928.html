<PRE>Hi,

I'm really happy tonight.  ;) ;) ;) ;)
I've finally managed to play correctly MP2 musics.

DMA_play -&gt; DSP_Record is correctly synchronized in handshake mode.

I've tested with WinUae core, everything is perfect, sound is clear.
I've also tested with the old core, music seems to be played too slowly 
(certainly because of the wrong 68030 cycles counting).

I've tested the following demos and programs :

revert (Mikro)
Amanita (DHS)
MP2 player
Don't break the oath (DHS)
Beam (Tscc)

They all work perfectly now.
There's still the Wait demo from Toys which delivers no sound at all.

It may let run some other programs.

Many thanks to Tomas for his explanations of the 2bits shifting while 
transferring the data.

Regards

Laurent


PS : About sound, I still have the same problem : I launch hatari, then 
I run any program with sound. It sounds dirty. I quit the program (but 
not hatari) and launch it again (I haven't changed anything). It plays 
crystal clear.

Sometimes, it plays well immediately. Sometimes, I have to run the 
program twice times or more before having nice sound, but always in the 
same hatari cession.
