&gt;<i> Le 20/03/2011 19:53, Eero Tamminen a &#233;crit :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Anything for the STE PowerUp game STE music? :-)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't remember this one ; what's was wrong, so I can see if I can 
</I>&gt;<i> reproduce ?
</I>
For this one, the problem is that sound frame start and sound frame end 
are 4 bytes length.
So, the values change too often for our actual code.

I tried a long time ago to code the Ste DMA sound as I did for the 
crossbar, this game worked better but it generated a lot of regressions.
I think the only way to have it working is to have a cycle_exact cpu.



 &gt; I tested several Falcon demos using DSP with the old core and it 
seems thatseveral have regressed (at least couple EKO's&amp;  Lazer's demos, 
Hmmm demo).
&gt;&gt;<i> I guess the reason is that how timings are done has changed in DSP_Run()
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from what was in v1.4.  How that gets called is different between the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CPU
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cores too:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ----
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> $ grep DSP_Run uae-cpu/*.c
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uae-cpu/newcpu.c:       DSP_Run( 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cycles_GetCounter(CYCLES_COUNTER_CPU) );
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> uae-cpu/newcpu.c:       DSP_Run( 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Cycles_GetCounter(CYCLES_COUNTER_CPU) );
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> $ grep DSP_Run cpu/*.c
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cpu/newcpu.c:                       DSP_Run(cpu_cycles* 2 / CYCLE_UNIT);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cpu/newcpu.c:               DSP_Run(cpu_cycles* 2 / CYCLE_UNIT);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> cpu/newcpu.c:               DSP_Run(cpu_cycles* 2 / CYCLE_UNIT);
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Laurent, is there something you could do for this?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
The difference is in newcpu.c, but also in dsp.c.
The 68030 instructions are really more precise with the new core.
The difference is really noticeable with music quality for example.

It's not only DSP that is impacted, but also the crossbar (and many 
timings are related both to DSP and crossbar).


&gt;<i> This way of counting cycles should be equivalent. The main difference 
</I>&gt;<i> is that old cpu doesn't have correct cpu cycle for 68030 instruction 
</I>&gt;<i> (it uses 68000 timings) whereas new core has correct 68030 cycle 
</I>&gt;<i> counting.
</I>&gt;<i> So, this is not fixable with old cpu core. This is clearly an example 
</I>&gt;<i> of things that will only work with new core, nothing we can do about 
</I>&gt;<i> this (without loosing a lot of time by duplicating 2 dsp cores).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wouldn't call these &quot;regressions&quot; in that case, because it was more 
</I>&gt;<i> or less working by luck with old cpu core : dsp code was tailored to 
</I>&gt;<i> make the demo works with a bad cycle counting. Now that we have 
</I>&gt;<i> correct timing in new cpu core, dsp was adjusted to work in the 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;correct&quot; way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think we need to &quot;maintain&quot; DSP with old cpu core, regressions 
</I>&gt;<i> will happen, but huge improvements will happen too with new cpu core
</I>&gt;<i> -&gt; dsp issues with only old cpu core should now be discarded/ignored 
</I>&gt;<i> if the programs work with new cpu core.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree totally here.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> PS. WinUAE's core doesn't have DSP_Run() calls in all m68k_run_* 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> functions,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> should it have (at least in few more of them)?
</I>
No, not for now.

m68k_run_1 is 68000 only, so no DSP needed
m68k_run_1_ce is cycle exact for 68000 only (not working at all for 
now), no DSP needed
m68k_run_jit is not working too

m68k_run_mmu040 runs well with DSP (only MMU opcodes don't work for now ;)
m68k_run_2ce is cycle exact for 68020+ processors (doesn't work for now)
m68k_run_2p is prefetch mode for 68020+ processors. Works with DSP. The 
best falcon mode for now
m68k_run_2 is 68020+ emulation (no prefetch, no mmu, no cycle exact). 
Works with DSP.


&gt;<i> Some m68k_run_* functions are not supposed to be called in Falcon 
</I>&gt;<i> mode, so this could be normal. Anyway, we can unify this latter when 
</I>&gt;<i> all other cpu issues are fixed.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

Laurent
