I didn't try the new falcon code, but from the graphs it seems to be 
faster. Nevertheless, I also agree with Eero that another precise way to 
measure improvment is to run a snapshot for a number of VBL and see if 
it takes more or less time.

In the case of &quot;simpler&quot; functions, another could indicator could be to 
just build a small test program that would do 1000000 calls of 
Update_e_u_n_z old/new versions and see which one is faster (this way 
you can get a real percentage of the speedup).

It's not always possible, but removing &quot;if&quot; is sometimes possible by 
doing binary and/or or things like that. Sometimes 2 instructions that 
are always executed can be faster that 1 conditional &quot;if&quot;.
Code where you handle bits is often a good candidate for this kind of 
optimisation (I remember greatly optimizing some popular depacking 
routines on 68000 this way years ago).

But there's no general rule, it's really up to your imagination.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It might be possible that my i3 CPU scales its speed according to
</I>&gt;<i> the load[2] though and that's why I don't see the differences.  I hadn't
</I>&gt;<i> thought of that earlier. If it does scaling, then &quot;top&quot; isn't valid way
</I>&gt;<i> to measure anything.
</I>
It certainly does ; check &quot;cat /proc/cpuinfo&quot; to see if the &quot;cpu MHZ&quot; is 
changing depending on the overall load. In that case, using top is not a 
good option.

The best option is a profiler that would completly emulate an i5x6 cpu 
with cycle precise value for each instruction. The program will usually 
run very slowly, but in the end you get an exact cycle count of what 
happened. If I recall correctly, there're such profiler under linux, but 
I don't remember their names.
