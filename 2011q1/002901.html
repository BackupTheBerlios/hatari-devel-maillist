<PRE>Hi,

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Music is clean too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No, it only works at 32 Mhz, at 16 Mhz, the screen is not correctly
</I>&gt;<i> updated.
</I>
With --cpuclock 32 it works fine with 1.4 release too, not just latest
Hatari.

 
&gt;<i> This demo doesn't involve the DSP at all.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, the 16/32 Mhz problem seem to be only related to the 68x000 part of
</I>&gt;<i> the computer.
</I>
Right.  It's an interesting case for the Falcon timings as they're so
clearly visible, but only in what's shown on screen.


&gt;<i> I think it may comes from Videl emulation missing (wrong VBL, HBL, ...)
</I>&gt;<i> Do you agree ?
</I>
videl.c emulation doesn't do any HBL (line/palette switching stuff), it just
shows the whole screen at VBL from a memory position given in registers
and size given in registers with palette coming from suitable STe/TT/Falcon
registers.

The HBL stuff is all in video.c and AFAIK completely ST/STE specific.
All that stuff is quite hairy (full of special cases), I think currently
only Nicolas understands fully how it works, so I think this will need
his involvement...  It should be fairly well traceable nowadays though.
