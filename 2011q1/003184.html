<PRE>Hi,

Anything for the STE PowerUp game STE music? :-)

Sounds good to me.

It would be nice if somebody on this list could check the things that are in
the compability list mentioned to have issues with Hatari v1.0 or before:
- Enchanted Lands
- F15 Strike Eagle 2 (I'd remove this if nobody can test it)
- DevPac 2.2 Monst (crashy)
- Neochrome (rasters)
- Protracker STE (50kHz replay)

As those are really ancient issues...


&gt;<i> Regarding videl, any improvements will go in 1.5 as it should work with
</I>&gt;<i> old CPU core. But I think we should not postpone v1.5 release because of
</I>&gt;<i> Falcon's parts, else it will take much too long before a new release.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We'll release 1.5 with the current state of Falcon's emulation (except
</I>&gt;<i> if there're some real regressions in Falcon mode : we should fix them
</I>&gt;<i> before releasing)
</I>
I tested several Falcon demos using DSP with the old core and it seems that
several have regressed (at least couple EKO's &amp; Lazer's demos, Hmmm demo).  

I guess the reason is that how timings are done has changed in DSP_Run()
from what was in v1.4.  How that gets called is different between the CPU
cores too:
----
$ grep DSP_Run uae-cpu/*.c
uae-cpu/newcpu.c:       DSP_Run( Cycles_GetCounter(CYCLES_COUNTER_CPU) );
uae-cpu/newcpu.c:       DSP_Run( Cycles_GetCounter(CYCLES_COUNTER_CPU) );
$ grep DSP_Run cpu/*.c
cpu/newcpu.c:                       DSP_Run(cpu_cycles* 2 / CYCLE_UNIT);
cpu/newcpu.c:               DSP_Run(cpu_cycles* 2 / CYCLE_UNIT);
cpu/newcpu.c:               DSP_Run(cpu_cycles* 2 / CYCLE_UNIT);

Laurent, is there something you could do for this?

PS. WinUAE's core doesn't have DSP_Run() calls in all m68k_run_* functions,
should it have (at least in few more of them)?
