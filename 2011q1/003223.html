<PRE>Le 25/03/2011 22:59, Eero Tamminen a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> How much they can differ from center, 16 pixels?  128 pixels?
</I>
For example, left border is 26 bytes, but right border is 44 bytes, so 
you can have approx 40 pixels (I agree showing the full right border 
would display bad colors even on a real ST (due to hi res switch), but 
still it can be useful to fully display it if the user wants to).

&gt;&gt;<i> In fact, I wonder if we could have 2 sections : STF/STE and Falcon/TT
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In STF/STE, I think it would be better to have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - displayed pixels in left/right/top/bottom border
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - double X or double Y for low res
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    - double Y for med res
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There are currently no options for these in Hatari.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Borders calculation is internal to Screen_SetResolution() function, low
</I>&gt;<i> resolution supports only doubling in both resolutions and med-rez always
</I>&gt;<i> doubles Y.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I.e. only separate size setting in ST/STE/screen.c is whether to double
</I>&gt;<i> low-res.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, but that's why I'm planning to add support for Y too.


&gt;&gt;<i> (this is similar to what Steem does and I find it easier to understand
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that current &quot;max zoomed win&quot; that includes both the zoom factor and the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> border size.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Why user would want to specify each border width separately?
</I>&gt;<i> If all borders fit into his monitor, why he would want to see less of them?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> AFAIK the only reason to have the border size options was being able to
</I>&gt;<i> avoid Hatari trying to force a too large resolution and Hatari aborting
</I>&gt;<i> because that fails.  Because if user had happened to save those settings,
</I>&gt;<i> Hatari died every time it was started and it was forever unusable unless
</I>&gt;<i> user knew to remove ~/.hatari/hatari.sav file...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hatari getting the maximum resolution from Desktop size or user specifying
</I>&gt;<i> the max desired resolution directly is much superior way to do that than
</I>&gt;<i> user needing to hit the correct resolution size by calculating each border
</I>&gt;<i> value separately while keeping in mind their maximum values, that they can
</I>&gt;<i> be doubled etc.
</I>

The user might want it or not, so he can change the value as he likes, 
but from the point of view of :
  - maximum emulation accuracy
  - developping demos under Hatari as close as possible as a real ST
  - recording videos that match the result of a real ST

It can be very interesting to have an exact emulation of the video line, 
with different border size at least in windowed mode (we can force 
values when user enter &quot;real&quot; fullscreen mode)

I don't see where's the problem in windowed mode if the user wants 48 
pixels in left border and 54 pixels in right border ; cumulated with a 
normal 320 pixels line, you get 422 pixels for example, which could be 
doubled.
When going fullscreen, we truncate border values to whatever is needed 
to fit a line (for example 24 pixels in left/right if the monitor 
displays a multiple of 368 pixels per line).

User could still give a total line length in pixel, and in that case we 
compute nBorderPixelsRight / nBorderPixelsLeft for him, but I think 
there should be a way to give different values to those 2 variables.
