<PRE>Hi Nicolas,

 &gt; But if we want to split each bit of $ff8207 in a separate case, I 
think it's better to have one variable for each bit ; in this case, 
isFalconInSteMode was only used for the bus, that's why I thought it 
would be better to add &quot;Bus&quot; in its name.

For this, I agree, the name must be as close as possible to the purpose 
of the variable.

But I think there won't be any other variable.


Here is register $ff8007.b

  * Take into account the Falcon Bus Control register $ff8007.b
     $FFFF8007 Falcon Bus Control
         BIT 6 : F30 Start (0=Cold, 1=Warm)
         BIT 5 : STe Bus Emulation (0=on)
         BIT 3 : Blitter Flag (0=on, 1=off)
         BIT 2 : Blitter (0=8mhz, 1=16mhz)
         BIT 0 : 68030 (0=8mhz, 1=16mhz)

Bit 6 seems to be taken into account by the TOS (I've verified with warm 
and cold resets, the value seems to be set directly by the TOS in a 
correct way).

Bit 5 : it's the bit I created the new variable. This one needed to be 
taken into account in ioMem.c to enable/disable the bus errors.

Bit 3 : I don't know how to take this one into account (is it possible 
to &quot;remove&quot; the blitter on the fly ?)
This one is not related to STe compatibility, but is a Falcon parameter.
It won't be taken into account in ioMem.c but directly in ioMemTabFalcon 
as I did for nCpuFreqShift.
(Just tell me how to disable the Blitter and I add it).

Bit 2 : Blitter frequency. Not STe compatibility involved here (except 
that programs that want to be STe compatible set it and the CPU at 8 Mhz 
(a luck for us, as we can't separate the 2 frequencies for now)).
It won't go to ioMem.c but in ioMemTabFalcon (again, as I did for 
nCpuFreqShift)

Bit 0 : the same for the CPU (already implemented into ioMemTabFalcon 
with nCpuFreqShift change)

There's no DMA involved here.
Neither there's a bit for &quot;STe compatibility&quot;.


Ste compatibility in Falcon is an &quot;approximation&quot; of the real STE :
cycles (also at 8 Mhz) are cycles of the 68030, not the 68000.
DMA sound doesn't have Microwire neither LMC 1992
PSG shadow registers are allowed (no bus error), but there's no shadow 
values (values are not duplicated)
Video is taken into account by the Videl, not the shifter...

STe compatibility &quot;only&quot; means going to 8 Mhz, use the main registers 
and not the shadow ones, no LCM 1992, ...

Hope this helps !
Regards

Laurent

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Ok for the renaiming, but I think everything's done now.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; But maybe &quot;isFalconInSteMode&quot; could be renamed &quot;isFalconInSteBusMode&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ? Full STE mode means bus + cpu speed + blitter speed + dma sound
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Nearly OK here.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Full STe mode means STE mode bus + ( cpu speed + blitter speed) at 8 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Mhz.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> That's what we have.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Only thing to finish is to use all functions of $ff8007.b (having a CPU
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> at 16 Mhz and a blitter at 8 for example).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Or disable the blitter is another one.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (I don't think many programs use this anyway, so what we have actually
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seems suffisant for our needs).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DMA sound is another part taken into account into the crossbar.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Everything is already implemented for Ste emulation sound.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, I didn't mean STE mode was not nearly ready in falcon's 
</I>&gt;<i> emulation, it was more about the meaning of the variable. If 
</I>&gt;<i> isFalconInSteMode means setting blitter+cpu at 8 MHz, bus errors, 
</I>&gt;<i> shifter and dma sound, then I'm OK with keeping it named this way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But if we want to split each bit of $ff8207 in a separate case, I 
</I>&gt;<i> think it's better to have one variable for each bit ; in this case, 
</I>&gt;<i> isFalconInSteMode was only used for the bus, that's why I thought it 
</I>&gt;<i> would be better to add &quot;Bus&quot; in its name.
</I>&gt;<i> We could then have a higher level &quot;isFalconInSteMode&quot; variable that 
</I>&gt;<i> would imply isFalconInSteBusMode=1 + dmasound + 8 MHz + shifter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
