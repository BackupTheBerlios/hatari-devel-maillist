The old UAE CPU emulation works still fine for many things, but
what's the performance difference between it and the new CPU?
I.e. is there some reason why people would want to use old CPU
for Falcon emulation?

If we would &quot;support&quot; / test only new CPU for Falcon emulation, the build
scripts should be changed so that they generate two binaries:
* one with old CPU and DSP emulation disabled, for ST/STE, and
* another one for TT/Falcon with the new CPU &amp; DSP emulation enabled
as CPU cannot be switched at run-time.

The window title should also state this[1] although both would still support
all of the st/ste/tt/falcon --machine types.

[1] e.g. &quot;Hatari TT/Falcon v1.5&quot;.

Even if new CPU would eventually get as good ST/STE emulation as the old
one, for ST/STE it might still make sense to keep the old core for
performance reasons.


&gt;<i> I've added 1.4+ in the compatibility list.
</I>&gt;<i> But I don't say that it needs the new CPU to work well.
</I>
It would be nice to have some way still to find which programs require
the new CPU to work properly.  Maybe:
- Don't Break The Oath
- Outline 2006 invite
- Beams

Demos comments should still mention that they use NoCrew MP2 player?

(Then there could be a general comment about NoCrew MP2 player needing
new CPU core for it to sound OK.)
