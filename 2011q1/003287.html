</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (when it gets 4 bytes past the screen buffer, Hatari crashes)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Tough one, I spent some time figuring what was wrong. In fact, due to a
</I>&gt;<i> very buggy loader in the boot sector, this demo can sometime consider it
</I>&gt;<i> needs to load $c18f sectors with xbios(8) ! Since memory location for
</I>&gt;<i> the sector is incremented by 512 bytes on each sector, you end up
</I>&gt;<i> filling the whole ram (as well as the IO space !) with garbage read from
</I>&gt;<i> wrong sectors.
</I>
How that can cause *Hatari* to crash here:
         else
               /* left border not removed, clear to color '0' */
               memset(pSTScreen,0,SCREENBYTES_LEFT);
?

Is pSTscreen address taken from emulated RAM without checking that
the pointed screen actually is within the emulated RAM?

Hatari crash is much more serious than demo crash. :-)


&gt;<i> The problem is that at the start of the boot sector D1=3e7bxxxx (number
</I>&gt;<i> of sectors to read) and the loader doesn't clear the upper 16 bits...
</I>&gt;<i> Now, since it works under Steem with the same TOS, I needed to
</I>&gt;<i> understand why the upper 16 bits were 0 on a real STE.
</I>&gt;<i> In fact, those bits in D1 are the result of initializing the TOS
</I>&gt;<i> date/time by reading the real time clock at $fffc21-3f.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Since normal STF/STE didn't have an RTC, this loader worked (more or
</I>&gt;<i> less by luck). When there's no RTC, D1=0 at the start of the boot.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Note that it depends on the TOS : with 1.04 or 1.62, D1!=0 but with 2.06
</I>&gt;<i> the loader starts.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> But after that, when all sectors are loaded, the demo check there's no
</I>&gt;<i> cardridge connected to the ST (at $fa0000). Since HD emulation is at the
</I>&gt;<i> same space under Hatari, it's considered as an ripping cardridge and the
</I>&gt;<i> demo wipes the whole RAM with the blitter -&gt; bus errors again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So, to run this demo, you need to disable RTC and HD emulation.
</I>
Verified.  Without these the demo works and Hatari doesn't segfault.


&gt;<i> I added a note for this in compatibility.html.
</I>
I don't see this in repo, did you remember to push it?


&gt;<i> &gt; * Songs of the Unexpected gets double bus error after playing the first
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; song
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     in the main demo for a while:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	<A HREF="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=22398">http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=22398</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I can reproduce, it's quite random and never at the same time, so a
</I>&gt;<i> little hard to fix for now.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Aura's Hifidelity dreams seems now fine:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	<A HREF="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=996">http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=996</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It was an FDC problem that I fixed in 2008/12
</I>
It's a nice demo, maybe it should be listed in compat list? :-)


&gt;<i> &gt; * Delirious 3 crashes on startup:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    <A HREF="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=21347">http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=21347</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Worked for me. Have you tried in STE mode ?
</I>
Yes, but actually the Pouet demo seems to be a different one than what
I had. Pouet version file name is delir_3.msa and it doesn't react where it
asks me to press either 1) or 2) i.e. demo is stuck in that screen.

The file name for version I had was delirs3a.msa.  I have no idea where
I got it (i.e. whether it's even supposed to work), sorry about that.


&gt;<i> &gt; * Once the actual demo starts:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    <A HREF="http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=15437">http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=15437</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Bad taste dies to:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    Your Atari program just did something terribly stupid:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    VoidMem_xlate($533b0aa5)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I get this a few seconds after the yellow/red vector balls appear. Do
</I>&gt;<i> you get the error at the same point ?
</I>
Yes.


&gt;<i>  From what I see, the demo code seems to be altered by a bad write at
</I>&gt;<i> address $404c2. The resulting wrong instruction tries to add.w on an odd
</I>&gt;<i> address, which creates this crash.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will need to add some code in Hatari to track what part of the demo is
</I>&gt;<i> producing this bad write.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * AFL pro fooball doesn't anymore freeze on startup:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    <A HREF="../2010q2/002284.html">http://lists.berlios.de/pipermail/hatari-devel/2010q2/002284.html</A>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    But there's some screen update/color issue between the game halves
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    (when running a demo game) when panels from top&amp;  bottom are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    scrolled towards screen center.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * GGN's Kuovadis game (Daleks clone) dies at startup after screen goes
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; blank
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    and it tries to scan disk for mods.  I'm not sure where I got the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    program,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    GGN's page seems to be missing a link:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	<A HREF="http://users.hol.gr/~ggn/">http://users.hol.gr/~ggn/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Havent't tested these 2 ones for now.
</I>
