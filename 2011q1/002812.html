<PRE>I added the +1 to have the demo &quot;ROT3DBMP.PRG&quot; or &quot;BOUND3.PRG&quot; run. 
(probably some other programs, but I don't remember).

This +1 is really &quot;the limit&quot; to let these programs run correctly or not.

I've already tested some things without it, but it seems to be needed to 
work.

I agree it should not be there.

Perhaps DSP timings (cycles) are still not perfect, but I've done many 
tests with them.

I know that there can be differences in DSP cycles with interrupts, but 
to be completely perfect, we should had a 3 instructions pipeline in the 
DSP.
Until now, I haven't had to code this pipeline (I simulate it in DSP 
interrupts, and I take the extra cycles in account, according to the 
Motorola DSP documentation).

Maybe the problem is not there anyway. (There's still this 32Mhz problem 
with EKO_System demo that may explain some things).

Another try I tested without success : the Host Interface (DSP &lt;--&gt; 
68030 exchanges on portB) is running at 8 Mhz, not 32. I've tested this 
last week, but I didn't noticed any change.

Your &quot;new look&quot; on this problem is really welcome.

Regards

Laurent

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> I don't run falcon demos that often, so could you tell if the demos
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> fully works up to the end without your proposed patch ? If it stops,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> can you tell me where so I can be sure to really work on the same 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> bases.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Without the patch, Eko_System crashes after 2 effect.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> First, there's the little presentation.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then, there's a tridi transparent gouraud ball (which doesn't display
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> without the patch)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then, a little tridi word.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Then 3d Gouraud fruits (apple, lemon, ...) (Demo crash here without the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> patch).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> With my patch (I mean not the latest proposition you told me to try), it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> runs to the end.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hello,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I add some time to make a few tests, and I think some things are wrong 
</I>&gt;<i> in current approach and they appear in more complex demos like eko 
</I>&gt;<i> system.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you say, removing the last call to DSP_Run as I proposed stops the 
</I>&gt;<i> first gouraud ball from displaying.
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that if I add :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>                 if ( Cycles_GetCounter(CYCLES_COUNTER_CPU) != 0 )
</I>&gt;<i>                         fprintf ( stderr , &quot;cpu count!=0\n&quot; );
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> before calling this last DSP_Run, you will see that there're very few 
</I>&gt;<i> prints, which is what I expected because the 2 calls added above 
</I>&gt;<i> should already run the dsp for the needed cycles (so DSP_Run will be 
</I>&gt;<i> called with a parameter &quot;0&quot;).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What this means and is confirmed when looking at DSP_Run is that 
</I>&gt;<i> DSP_Run is calling dsp56k_execute_instruction() at least once, even if 
</I>&gt;<i> nHostCycles==0, which is not possible on a real falcon, you can't 
</I>&gt;<i> execute more dsp instructions if the cpu (which is bound to the master 
</I>&gt;<i> clock) did not have an increase in cycle counter.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, at first sthg like :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         if (nHostCycles == 0)
</I>&gt;<i>                 return;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> should be added to the start of DSP_Run. But this is not enough as the 
</I>&gt;<i> demos still doesn't work correctly.
</I>&gt;<i> I need to make more tests, but I have the feeling that the &quot;- 
</I>&gt;<i> save_cycles + 1&quot; and the &quot;save_cycles = cycles&quot; at the end are not 
</I>&gt;<i> correct.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> save_cycles will be &lt;=0, if it's &lt;0, it means the dsp executed 1 more 
</I>&gt;<i> instruction that it should between the time allowed by the cpu. So, on 
</I>&gt;<i> next call, you should execute 1 less instruction and as save_cycle&lt;0, 
</I>&gt;<i> the line should be more like :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sint32 cycles = nHostCycles * ( DSP_FREQ / CPU_FREQ ) + save_cycles + 1;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> But then, I don't see why a &quot;+ 1&quot; ? Once we test nHostCycles==0, we 
</I>&gt;<i> know DSP_FREQ=CPU_FREQ*4, so there should be no rounding error.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> These are just some quick traces I made, I need to spend more time on 
</I>&gt;<i> this to correctly fix it. But in the meantime, I don't think it's 
</I>&gt;<i> useful to commit the patch to m68k_run1, the bases are not stable 
</I>&gt;<i> enough and this would not correct the real source of the problem (but 
</I>&gt;<i> in the end, I agree DSP_Run should be called more often in m68k_run1)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards
</I>&gt;<i>
