How much they can differ from center, 16 pixels?  128 pixels?

IMHO it's best to do this just by blanking the extra pixels.  While windows
can have arbitrary widths, fullscreen resolutions cannot, they're always
aligned.


&gt;<i> In fact, I wonder if we could have 2 sections : STF/STE and Falcon/TT

&gt;<i> In STF/STE, I think it would be better to have
</I>&gt;<i>   - displayed pixels in left/right/top/bottom border

</I>&gt;<i>   - double Y for med res
</I>
There are currently no options for these in Hatari.

Borders calculation is internal to Screen_SetResolution() function, low
resolution supports only doubling in both resolutions and med-rez always
doubles Y.

I.e. only separate size setting in ST/STE/screen.c is whether to double
low-res.

(By selecting TV as monitor, as a special effect &amp; slight speedup, every
other line would be drawn as blank.)


&gt;<i> (this is similar to what Steem does and I find it easier to understand
</I>&gt;<i> that current &quot;max zoomed win&quot; that includes both the zoom factor and the
</I>&gt;<i> border size.
</I>
Why user would want to specify each border width separately?
If all borders fit into his monitor, why he would want to see less of them?

AFAIK the only reason to have the border size options was being able to
avoid Hatari trying to force a too large resolution and Hatari aborting
because that fails.  Because if user had happened to save those settings,
Hatari died every time it was started and it was forever unusable unless
user knew to remove ~/.hatari/hatari.sav file...

Hatari getting the maximum resolution from Desktop size or user specifying
the max desired resolution directly is much superior way to do that than 
user needing to hit the correct resolution size by calculating each border
value separately while keeping in mind their maximum values, that they can
be doubled etc.
