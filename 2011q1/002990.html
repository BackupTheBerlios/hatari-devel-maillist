<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> &gt; starting Hatari the issue is gone. But in this case I have a different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; problem: The Hatari window is placed elsewhere on the screen (looks as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; if the Window manager now places the window at a location not yet used
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; by other windows) and the Hatari and X11 mouse cursor are not properly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; synchronized anymore.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To keep mouse cursor in sync, you need to enable mouse grabbing.  To have it
</I>&gt;<i> in sync from the beginning, you need to have mouse grab enabled from the
</I>&gt;<i> beginning. There's a &quot;--grab&quot; command line option for latter and keyboard
</I>&gt;<i> shortcut just for former.
</I>
But why is the Hatari windows placed at a different screen location when
starting Hatari with bUseExtVdiResolutions set to FALSE instead of TRUE?

&gt;<i> When you earlier said that:
</I>&gt;<i> 	the print preview (as well as the actualprintout) do not correctly
</I>&gt;<i> 	recognize the paper size (A4) anymore. The output is clipped, so that
</I>&gt;<i> 	only the upper left corner is visible.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> to what size it's clipped?   E.g. size of ST-low or ST-high screen size?
</I>
I think it's even less. I have added a screenshot to this posting. The
screen region in white is the area the Tarkus software, most likely
based on VDI information, clips the DIN A4 page size to. With
bUseExtVdiResolutions set to FALSE the complete page is white, and when
actually printing the complete sheet of paper is printed to. With
bUseExtVdiResolutions set to TRUE only the white area is printed to,
i.e. the printout is incomplete (clipped), just as the print preview
indicates.
Please note that with older versions of Hatari even with
bUseExtVdiResolutions set to TRUE there was no clipping and the
printouts were complete.

&gt;<i> Do similar issues happen with any other software?
</I>
I don't know because I do not use any other software which so
extensively uses the VDI, i.e. I have not observed similar problems with
other pieces of software.

&gt;<i> I need some way to reproduce the issue, otherwise I cannot debug it.
</I>&gt;<i> Is this software available somewhere?
</I>
No, I'm afraid it isn't.

&gt;<i> With your config I could reproduce the crash and it happened also with v1.4
</I>&gt;<i> release.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've commited a fix to the crash and to another issue revealed by the fix.
</I>
Thank you, there is no crash anymore.

Best regards

Uwe
