&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First, I thank you for the time passed on this analysis.
</I>&gt;<i> It explains many things I can detect while debugging the Falcon.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with both points, but I think the most important one is the second (CPU freq).
</I>&gt;<i> As long as everything in the emulated falcon is driven by the CPU clock, it doesn't worth a try to change anything with the older core (except, as you said, correcting DSP related problems).
</I>&gt;<i> This may explain the bad sound quality at high frequencies (because cyc_int is wrong), demos running only at 32 Mhz, some DSP stack overflow if Host Interface interrupts are called too often, ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For info, the only &quot;specific&quot; code I added was the +1 cycle in DSP_Run.
</I>&gt;<i> All other parts of the falcon code I wrote are done with &quot;real&quot; values (cycles counting, crossbar, DSP host interface, ...)
</I>&gt;<i> This mean that the only way to improve the falcon emulation is to change the CPU core.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think that our main priority for the next months should be running hatari with WinUae Core :
</I>&gt;<i>     a) actually, it compiles, and runs some programs and demos (ST and Falcon mode)
</I>&gt;<i>     b) let's emulate completely the STF and STE (at least at the same level than our old core does)
</I>&gt;<i>     c) next, we can add the 68030 with DSP
</I>&gt;<i>     d) let's then add the cycle exact to the 68000 (STF, STE)
</I>&gt;<i>     e) next, the Falcon in cycle_exact emulation
</I>&gt;<i>     f) next, 68040, fast memory, 68060, 64 Mo of RAM, ... ;)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Except if there are still some things to add to the current version you're working on, I think we should concentrate on the following list:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Hello, I agree with the goals of all these points, but I think we could 
do it in a different order (see end of this mail).

1st, regarding frequency, it's a &quot;problem&quot; that we use a master clock of 
8 Mhz for falcon (same as STF/STE), but not a too important one because 
Falcon use integer multiples of this freq (16 and 32), so we can adapt 
the different components using &gt;&gt;1 or &gt;&gt;2 to make them &quot;speak&quot; at the 
same freq (what is important is not the absolute value per se, but the 
ratio between the frequencies).

Anyway, I'm planning to change a few things in Hatari to really have a 
16 Mhz or 32 Mhz freq for cpu (that is doubling the number of 
instructions per second by doubling the freq and not by halving the 
cycle count of each instruction).

But changing this freq things won't fix anything, it will make things 
&quot;nicer&quot; and more similar to a real hardware, but we could fix all this 
too by keeping the 8Mhz main clock and using &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; to get the good 
ratio.

The real immediate improvement will come from using 68030 cycle count.


Now, regarding the switch to Winuae, I think it would be best to keep 
STF/STE apart from now and consider we use this core only for now to fix 
the Falcon. When Falcon works better/perfectly regarding cycles and DSP 
sync, then we can add 68000 specific code used for STF/STE to Winuae.

I would prefer this order, because adapting Winuae for the falcon will 
require very few changes to the 68030 emulation. The falcon programs 
don't use such strict timings as those required for fullscreen on STF/STE.

For me, 68000's patches are really the final stage, and lots of these 
patches are anyway rather ugly and would need to be rewritten to be 
adapted to a cleaner base as provided by winuae.

If we modify winuae to immediatly supports all the &quot;tricks&quot; we added for 
68000 in uae, then I fear we might break a working winuae's core and 
when we will try to make the 68030 work, there will be so many 
modifications that we won't be able to see the differences between what 
we &quot;broke&quot; and what was not good in winuae.

Winuae's core for 68030 is I think very close to what we need for 
falcon, so we should keep it as untouched as possible and first try to 
integrate it for Falcon mode.
This way we will be confident that the integration and the bases of 
winuae are ok for Hatari, and we can backport 68000's patches one after 
the other in this core (68000 is a less powerful CPU than 68030, but 
it's used with so much &quot;precision&quot; in STF/STE demos that fully 
implementing it will be more complicated than for the 68030, where we 
basically need only a good cycle count for each instruction)



So, I think we should find different Falcon demos, from simple to more 
evolved, that will allow us to test the cpu, then cpu+sound, then 
cpu+dsp, and so on (as videl is not correctly emulated now, we should 
avoid demos that make too much use of it for now).

If we can run GEM + a few simple demos in falcon mode with WinUae's 
core, I'm quite confident we will be able to quickly fix the sync issues 
we have now.

For now, we could even imagine that for next release there would be a 
hatari_st.bin (built with uae) and hatari_falcon.bin (built with winuae).

Having 2 binaries for each machine is not the final goal, but it could 
be a transition step to check each machine is correctly emulated (before 
merging everything in winuae's core)
