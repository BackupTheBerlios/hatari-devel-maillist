<PRE>Hi,

I tested with old core.


&gt;<i> I've tested the following demos and programs :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> revert (Mikro)
</I>&gt;<i> Amanita (DHS)
</I>
Sound is &quot;scratchy&quot;.

&gt;<i> MP2 player
</I>
This is otherwise quite OK, but the sounds in most mp2 files like beams.mp2
is clearly a bit &quot;scratchy&quot;.

&gt;<i> Don't break the oath (DHS)
</I>
Sound is &quot;sratchy&quot;.

&gt;<i> Beam (Tscc)
</I>
At some point in the demo, I stop hearing any sounds.  Demo still
continues fine though and sound comes back at credits.  Sound isn't
&quot;scratchy&quot; like in others.


&gt;<i> They all work perfectly now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There's still the Wait demo from Toys which delivers no sound at all.
</I>
Verified.


&gt;<i> It may let run some other programs.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Many thanks to Tomas for his explanations of the 2bits shifting while
</I>&gt;<i> transferring the data.
</I>...
&gt;<i> PS : About sound, I still have the same problem : I launch hatari, then
</I>&gt;<i> I run any program with sound. It sounds dirty. I quit the program (but
</I>&gt;<i> not hatari) and launch it again (I haven't changed anything). It plays
</I>&gt;<i> crystal clear.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Sometimes, it plays well immediately. Sometimes, I have to run the
</I>&gt;<i> program twice times or more before having nice sound, but always in the
</I>&gt;<i> same hatari cession.
</I>
The &quot;scratchiness&quot; in sound could be what you're describing here... :-)
