I noticed that I can get that info also from:
	cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq
In addition to:
	grep -i mhz /proc/cpuinfo

Polling those with e.g. &quot;cat&quot; isn't enough though, I think the frequency
can be changed quite fast (several times per second).  And according to:
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies

There are quite a few frequencies at which (each of these virtual cores[1])
can be running.

[1] i3 has two cores which both simulate an extra core with hyperthreading.

I would guess that if something uses all CPU constantly (hatari with
--fast-forward), the cpu governor would keep it at highest frequency.
Then one needs timing though (--run-vbls with Hatari) as I mentioned
in earlier mail, as CPU usage will/should be then constantly at 100%...

It's called Valgrind. :-)

Its callgrind plugin gives callgraphs, but simulates just instructions,
the cachegrind plugin can simulate also cache misses etc (but lacks
callgraph info).
