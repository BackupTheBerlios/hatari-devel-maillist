<PRE>Le 26/01/2011 00:21, David Savinkoff a &#233;crit :

&gt;<i> When I use my (synchronizing + sample-rate controlling) patch with
</I>&gt;<i> either a 50Hz TOS or a 60Hz TOS, I always get:
</I>&gt;<i> Host system has accurate delays. (2)  ,or (3), or (4)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The latest Hatari (unpatched) always shows:
</I>&gt;<i> Host system has accurate delays. (2)  ,or (3), or (4)
</I>&gt;<i> for 50Hz TOS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The latest Hatari (unpatched) always shows:
</I>&gt;<i> Host system does not have accurate delays. (22)  ,or (23)
</I>&gt;<i> for 60Hz TOS
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe this test could be improved, but I don't think it is the problem.
</I>&gt;<i> This, however, gives insight into my system (not accurate).
</I>
That's strange, in all these 3 cases Main_CheckForAccurateDelays() is 
the same, so it should give the same results. I don't understand how you 
get different values (22 or 23).

Or maybe some other tasks were running at the same time as Hatari ?


Anyway, I'm convinced the problem is in the fact we only have 
millisecond precision. As you said earlier, at 60 Hz, we get 16.6666 ms 
per VBL, which is truncated to 16 ms (we could round this to 17, it 
would be a little better, but problem would remain).

So, I'm wondering if we should use nanosleep() when available (instead 
of SDL_Delay which is not precise enough)

nanosleep is defined in POSIX.1-2001, so it should be OK to use under 
Linux and OSX. It seems cygwin is also providing a nanosleep function 
that uses Windows' internal calls, so it should be good for Windows too.

With nanosleep, we could get a much better granularity.

We could define our own &quot;FineSleep&quot; function and uses the best possible 
alternatives depending on the OS / compilation flags (1st nanosleep, 
then SDL_Delay, active wait on SDL_GetTicks, etc.).

I think it would fix the VBL precision problem with very few changes to 
Hatari. Any opinion on this ?

PS : please leave hatari-devel as [cc] in your reply, it's better to 
archive these discussions on the mailing list.
