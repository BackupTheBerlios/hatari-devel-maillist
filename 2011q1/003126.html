I had earlier added support for limiting any resolution request to
desktop size.

Attached is a patch to make fullscreen mode always use the current desktop
resolution for Falcon &amp; TT resolutions[1].  It's enabled by giving Hatari
a &quot;--desktop&quot; command line option.

Does it do what you were looking after?

[1] ST &amp; STE mode screen handling doesn't have scaling with arbitrary
     integer factor, just doubling, so doing that for those too wouldn't
     look very nice.  I don't thing it's a problem though as ST/STE demos
     don't by themselves cause Hatari resolution changes like Falcon demos
     do.


(When I had it enabled also for non-fullscreen mode and did couple of
fullscreen switches, SDL somehow managed to mess up my Linux desktop so
badly that I had to kill the whole session to see anything else than black. 
Doing it just for fullscreen would seem to work fine though.)


	- Eero

PS. I'm now using an LCD monitor too and they indeed are bloody slow
at changing resolutions, so this started to be a more interesting issue...
