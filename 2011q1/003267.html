<PRE>First I want to apologize! I was certainly overreacting here but my main
point is still valid that the code should be more optional and backward
compatible.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are you really sure GP2X doesn't have a newer libsdl?
</I>
I have a binary version of what it seems is 1.2.13. The problem is there
are no header files shipped with it. I will have to ship that libSDL
with hatari anyway because it fixes a sad tearing problem which the
official libSDL from GPH has.

There is a source distribution of this patched libSDL but I really don't
know if I can simply rip the header files and use them with the compiler
environment. I don't want to mess up the working compiler setup I have.

&gt;<i> &gt; What is so difficult to think about backward compatibility or making
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code parts OPTIONAL at compile time?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I checked what SDL versions all Linux distros ship before adding the 
</I>&gt;<i> functionality needed by Laurent (limiting Hatari window to Desktop size
</I>&gt;<i> so that it doesn't crash his X server) and Anders (not changing resolution
</I>&gt;<i> as it messes his OSX virtual desktops).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Only distros where one could still find that old version of SDL is
</I>&gt;<i> the commercial RedHat Enterprise Linux v4 (+ its commercial Oracle &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> free CentOS derivatives) that was released on 2005:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux#Life_Cycle_Dates">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux#Life_Cycle_Dates</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> None of the currently available Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, SUSE, Mandriva etc
</I>&gt;<i> distro versions (e.g. Debian oldstable) have it anymore available and of
</I>&gt;<i> course any RHEL distro where new Hatari version would be included will have
</I>&gt;<i> new enough SDL version.
</I>
It's still a special feature that could be made entirely optional.
Afterall Hatari had no serious problems before. The whole adaption is a
nice-to-have thing that benefits users of desktop system but hardly
other targets such as handheld consoles.
&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Stop applying the Java &quot;no code has to be optional&quot; approach to portable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; C sources!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As I don't have that obsolete SDL version, I cannot test functionality
</I>&gt;<i> for it.
</I>
But adding a whole #ifdef around the code should be no problem. If it
has been proven the #ifdefs cann still be removed.

&gt;<i> If you want Hatari to have support for SDL versions that nobody else has
</I>&gt;<i> ready access to, you're the one that needs to support them and test that
</I>&gt;<i> this support works.  If that support is really needed and can be added
</I>&gt;<i> cleanly to Hatari, there isn't a problem.
</I>
As except for this code piece all compiles we will have to see.


&gt;<i> According to your comments the code &amp; documentation part should look
</I>&gt;<i> something like the attached patch.  SDL seems to have macro for checking
</I>&gt;<i> for SDL version, so it might be possible that it doesn't need changes to
</I>&gt;<i> CMake.
</I>
I checked those version macros aswell. The problem is, they only work at
runtime while the problem already occurs at compile time.


&gt;<i> PS. The new SDL requirement is not the only thing that had changed in Hatari
</I>&gt;<i> since v1.4, Thomas for example removed the support for Autotools &amp; plain
</I>&gt;<i> Makefiles (about which I complained a bit at the time :)).
</I>
I would use an older source version if Nicolas's code for ST emulation
was backward portable. I want ST(e) emulation, not Falcon so using v0.8
would be ok if I could have all DMA, scroll and overscan patches working
properly.

But I think the latest version can be brought to action aswell.

Please see my other specific posts.

Sorry again for sounding too rude! :(
Matthias
