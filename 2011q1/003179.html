<PRE>Hi,

Looks good to me.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I've improved it at the same time :
</I>&gt;<i> - no more stack messages (overflow or underflow) in disasm mode on RTI

</I>
What are the differences between DSP trace &amp; disasm modes and
when one would use which of them?

-&gt; This information should be in Hatari manual debugging section,
   under its own DSP debugging subsection I think.


&gt;<i> 2 questions :
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Do you think that trace dsp_registers and trace dsp_memory should be
</I>&gt;<i> added to the debugguer or should they stay as DEFINES and recompilation
</I>&gt;<i> in dsp_cpu code ?
</I>
How often they're needed compared to the normal disassembling?

Both add a check to speed-critical DSP function, but memory tracing
would need also switching an often used auxialiary function at run-time.


&gt;<i> - Is there a way to use the debugguer like this ?
</I>&gt;<i>         db pc=$'value' and then trace the N next lines of DSP code
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> DSP debugging sorts so many lines, I's like to be able to just display

</I>&gt;<i> value, ...
</I>
You can set a breakpoint to the condition you like with the &quot;:info&quot; modifier
and then use the &quot;lock file&quot; info command to give/lock a file containing
the debugger commands that you want to be run[1] when the breakpoint is hit.

In above case the file should in theory be something like:
	trace dsp_disasm
	cont 5
	trace none

But here's a similar problem as with your DSP disassembling.
Within the breakpoint, the CPU core flag for entering debugger is set,
so CPU core returns immediately to debugger instead of continuing for
5 instructions.

For now all you can run from breakpoint is the trace command, rest of
the actions you unfortunately need to do from the debugger prompt yourself.


[1] Even if the continue issue would be fixed, there's a second problem,
that the locked command (in this case parsing a debugger commands file)
would be executed also when debugger is re-entered, i.e. it would loop
recursively forever continuing.

To fix that:
1. breakpoints would need to use something else than the &quot;lock&quot; command
2. the CPU &amp; DSP cores and debugger need to be fixed so that it's possible
   to continue (for given number of steps) before getting back to debugger

Regarding 1), on retrospect I think the &quot;:info&quot; breakpoint flag wasn't so
hot idea because one might have multiple breakpoints on which he might want
different actions to be executed.  I could at some point change it to
&quot;:file &lt;file&gt;&quot; flag that allows specifying a separate debugger commands file
for each breakpoint.

As to 2), that would indeed be a nice feature... :-)   It might also help
in enabling breakpoint usage from Python UI (haven't really thought
about that).
