Hello

Well, we can always ship a &quot;hatari_experimental_falcon.exe&quot; for the 
Windows release (as Windows people are not always aware of how to 
compile exe from the sources), but for the rest of the users, we'll just 
keep old CPU core as default when using ./configure and we could add 
some infos in the release note to explain how to build the more recent 
cpu core for falcon emulation.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We've had Hatari releases within 2-10 month intervals and it's already
</I>&gt;<i> 9 months since last release.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO there are enough features, usability enhancements and bug fixes
</I>&gt;<i> for a new release with:
</I>&gt;<i> - Spec512 med-res mode
</I>&gt;<i> - The &quot;hack&quot; to run Atari binaries directly with Hatari

</I>&gt;<i> - Memory state&amp;  restore fixes
</I>&gt;<i> - AVI recording usability improvements
</I>&gt;<i> - Your SDL file selector improvement
</I>&gt;<i> - Improvements&amp;  fixes to resolution change handling
</I>&gt;<i> - New dissassembler
</I>&gt;<i> - Profiling support
</I>&gt;<i> - DSP/Videl/Crossbar/AES/VDI tracing support
</I>&gt;<i> - Possibility to set breakpoints for OS functions
</I>&gt;<i> - TOS text output to console with --bios-intercept
</I>&gt;<i> etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would propose that we have new release within a month.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Nicolas, what do you think?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I also think a few improvements were made that would validate a new 
release. Most changes are small, but it's a fact that apart from Falcon 
emulation, Hatari now has a very good compatibility for STF/STE, so 
we're likely to have smaller incremental release in the future.

On my todo list, I have some fixes for dma audio/video synchronization 
(as reported by Evil / DHS in More Or Less Zero) as well as some 
precision improvements for ym sound. Code for that is already written, I 
need to integrate it and commit it.

I'd like also to improve the first/last 16 pixels in STE mode when 
overscan + hscroll are enabled (color 0 is sometimes shown in Hatari, 
while it wouldn't be seen on a real STE). This would complete the video 
changes I already made for STE since 1.4 was released.

Regarding a release date, I'd rather have a target around May in order 
to be able to complete the above tasks (maybe it will be ready before).

&gt;&gt;<i> In my next list :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - continue to improve new CPU compatibility
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - videl emulation
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> IMHO these could go to next release after v1.5.
</I>
Regarding videl, any improvements will go in 1.5 as it should work with 
old CPU core. But I think we should not postpone v1.5 release because of 
Falcon's parts, else it will take much too long before a new release.

We'll release 1.5 with the current state of Falcon's emulation (except 
if there're some real regressions in Falcon mode : we should fix them 
before releasing)
