Sure, but skip the crap ones, there are too many demos to list all of them.
(There are few enough games &amp; apps that specific for STE &amp; Falcon that
I think it's fine list all of them, but same is not true for demos or ST
stuff).

Initially some Falcon demos were listed just because they worked, but
I think we should now add only things that either:
- do something (from the emulation point of view) that other demos don't
  do (entry should mention what so that we have a test-case for  that
  feature),
- do something which Hatari cannot emulate yet, or
- are exceptionally good or otherwise notable :-)

</I>
There's Power Up STE game (I'll send it to you), and &quot;Systematic error&quot;
STE demo is listed as having distorted DMA sound (list has link to
pouet.net), but that comment is from Hatari v1.1 and pouet.net doesn't
have a link to video where one could check what it should sound like...

The sound issue could also be related to microwire emulation?
