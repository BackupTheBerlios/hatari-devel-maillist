</I>
At least on some mobile device LCDs the refresh rate of e.g. 50Hz
looks really awful.  Not sure why, maybe it's a question of backlight
&amp; power saving and not relevant to what computer monitor LCDs do.

I know about different scaling algorithms, I just don't understand why
your monitor/configuration cannot do that.  It's fixed to algorighm that's
best for video?

Hm.  Then it's probably the ancient Hatari version you're using.

You said that your Hatari is about year old.  There have been two releases
since that time, There was one bug that manifested on OSX that was fixed in
1.3, about half a year ago.  On some OSX builds frameskip variable got
overwritten (overwrite dependend how compiler located the variables), maybe
in your case some other variable related to resolution got overwritten.
