<PRE>Hello Thomas,

&gt;<i> I've now also spent some time to try out cmake on Mac OS X
</I>&gt;<i> on my old PowerMac... I tried to create a native Xcode project with
</I>&gt;<i> cmake, but that failed completely. First thing was, that I had to run
</I>&gt;<i> cmake twice for some strange reason, or it would not create all
</I>&gt;<i> necessary project files.
</I>
On the other project that used CMake, I also run cmake-gui, and it was
suggested  that I push &quot;configure&quot; as many times as needed in order to
generate the makefiles. So I guess that this is normal behaviour.

&gt;<i> Honestly, I am quite a bit disappointed now. I thought it would be
</I>&gt;<i> easier with cmake. And considering the problems that Christer and George
</I>&gt;<i> faced, and considering that the other main developers do not seem to be
</I>&gt;<i> interested in this topic, I think we should maybe better stick with the
</I>&gt;<i> old build system. CMake is certainly very nice for projects with simple
</I>&gt;<i> build rules, but when it comes to more complex build rules like the
</I>&gt;<i> ones for our CPU core, the portability and simplicity of cmake fades
</I>&gt;<i> away.
</I>
Another  thing to note was that after I overcame all the path problems
(which might be because of the way mingw/msys is set up), it halted on
an error while linking that I can't remember atm.

In  general,  I  dunno.  Cmake  seems  nice  enough  and has some good
features,  especially the gui version can make anyone set up paths and
locate  include files, etc, something I find hard to do with makefiles
(I  always hate having to add include paths, so I end hardcoding paths
in the source files).

However  if  maintaining it is a nuisance, and noone wants to do that,
it's  no  skin off my back (plus, the old makefiles work perfectly for
me nowdays).
