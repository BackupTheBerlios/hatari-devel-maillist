<PRE>Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; they were replaced by the cmake version). Which means a &quot;hg ci/push&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; would overwrite the original Makefile files on berlios, which may not
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be what we want.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there a way to handle this ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, there are several solutions:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) Force Eero to also use cmake, than we can remove the old
</I>&gt;<i>    Makefiles ;-)
</I>
I would say there are still quite a few (niche I guess, like Atari :-))
platforms where Makefiles are better supported than CMake (even CMake
itself uses make on Linux).  Maybe after v1.4, I'll support Makefiles until
that.

Btw. I quickly looked into the configure.ac and as the *.in files are
already removed, configure.ac itself cannot work anymore.   I.e. feel free
to remove it.


&gt;<i> 2) Use &quot;make distclean&quot; before the check-in, this should remove the
</I>&gt;<i>    generated Makefiles
</I>&gt;<i> 3) Do an out-of-source build instead, i.e. run the initial &quot;cmake&quot; from
</I>&gt;<i>    a separate folder that is not part of the source tree.
</I>
I think this is the best alternative.  Maybe the &quot;configure&quot; wrapper you've
added for CMake could automatically cause the build to be done in a separate
build subdirectory?


&gt;<i> 4) Maybe rename the old Makefiles to GNUmakefile, since this file name
</I>&gt;<i>    is accepted by GNU make, too...  but I doubt that this will work
</I>&gt;<i>    well since the name &quot;GNUmakefile&quot; seems to have a higher priority for
</I>&gt;<i>    make than &quot;Makefile&quot;.
</I>
