</I>&gt;<i> Nicolas, one of things that would be easy to do would be comparing

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> against the same releases on Sourceforge:
</I>&gt;<i> 	<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hatari/files/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/hatari/files/</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And what's in tagged in the BerliOS HG repository and your own HG
</I>&gt;<i> repository.
</I>
On the general point, I agree with Eero, I don't think Hatari would be an 
interesting target for hackers, due to its lack of network connectivity 
and its rather restricted users base (although they're very dedicated to 
the atari !).

Regarding the 1.3.1 sources available on berlios, I compared them with my 
current sources tree and didn't see anything that was not stricly hatari 
related.
Same for the hg tree stored on berlios, importing it doesn't show any 
difference to my own tree.

So, I would say Hatari was not a target of this attacker, was not modified 
by non-official commiter and can be safely packaged in any distro.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hatari has been at BerliosOS only about a year (move happened dec 2008)
</I>&gt;<i> and moved there because we were dissatisfied with Sourceforge:
</I>&gt;<i> - slow
</I>&gt;<i> - riddled with advertisements
</I>&gt;<i> - no distributed versoin control (Mercurial) support
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At least at that time there were no good other candinates for hosting that
</I>&gt;<i> would have provided Mercurial (even support for Git was patchy).  Are there
</I>&gt;<i> now?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Apart when server went down during a week end some months ago and this 
recent attack, I don't have the feeling berlios is a bad hosting solution. 
At least for the size of our project and its relatively small activity, I 
think it's just fine.
