In hatari, the behaviour will in fact be the same.

An MFP timer can't interrupt a 680xx instructions, but due to the way 
hatari is working, the cpu is driving the master clock and can't be 
interrupted on a sub instruction level.

On a real falcon, the bus will be mostly shared between cpu, dma, blitter 
and video. In that case those parts are running asynchronously, each one 
is waiting for its turn (the blitter can't interrupt the cpu for example)

But the dsp (or even the ikbd in fact) are working independantly of the 
main bus and can run synchronously to the cpu. So on a real machine, you 
could have some dsp event that occur at the same time that a cpu 
instruction is executed. But on Hatari, a cycint's timer will always be 
delayed to the end of the current instruction.

So, the longer the cpu instruction is, the more you will delay the 
execution of the dsp instructions for a time interval. And then it's true 
that when 30 or more cycles are used you might get a non &quot;regular&quot; flow of 
dsp instructions.

Unfortunately, many instructions are &gt; 30 cycles (the worst being movem)

That's why only a mode where we split instruction on every 2 cycles can 
give the best result, but it's a long way to go.
