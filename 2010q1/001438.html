<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> The underlying question could be : should we change the resolution of the

</I>&gt;<i> But on the other hand, perhaps we could also have a way of displaying

</I>&gt;<i> content of Atari's screen ? Of course, some combinations will not look

</I>
Another possibility is to tell the display not to offer any other than
the native LCD resolution[1]. Then Hatari will just keep using what ever
integer scaling it already used and just tell SDL to use that resolution.
This will give the black borders on fullscreen, but pixels are crisp.

[1] One has always had that possibility with X server configuration.

Even SDL itself may offer this, I haven't looked into it.


&gt;<i> So, perhaps we could implement a new .c file that would take an SDL
</I>&gt;<i> surface (320x200 for example) and transform this to a new SDL surface of
</I>&gt;<i> any size (in that case 640x400 or 1280x800 would of course be the best
</I>&gt;<i> choice for trivial resizing method).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think such an interface could be easy to add (this extra processing
</I>&gt;<i> step should be of course optionnal), just need a function like :
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   void ResizeSurface ( SDL_Surface *surface_in , SDL_Surface *surface_out
</I>&gt;<i> , int resize_method );
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> with resize_method like LINEAR, INTERPOLATE, BILINEAR, BICUBIC, HQ4X, ...
</I>
This will require support both from video.c and falcon/hostscreen.c and
rewrite of at least the hostscreen.c fullscreen toggling function (but
latter should apparently anyway be rewritten).

If somebody's interested in writing something like that, I'll be interested
to review the patch. :-)


&gt;<i> This way, we could offer both scaling modes (hardware or software) and
</I>&gt;<i> please everyone :)
