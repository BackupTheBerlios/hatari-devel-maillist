<PRE>Hi,

Please check the notes about address breakpoints changes below
if you're using Hatari debugger!

&gt;<i> Actually, I'm going to allow expression anywhere in debugger with similar
</I>&gt;<i> syntax.   (haven't finished implementing it yet.)
</I>
This is done.


&gt;<i> &gt; * Expression evaluation should support register, symbol &amp; variable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; names.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Then you could do also things like &quot;d a0+HBL&quot; or &quot;dd pc-8&quot;, not just &quot;d
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pc&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The downside is that except for few exceptions[1], you need to give them
</I>&gt;<i> in quotes.  This is to be able to differentiate disasm &amp; memdump ranges
</I>&gt;<i> from subtraction operation.  Upside is that you can use expressions for
</I>&gt;<i> both ends of the range, like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 	d &quot;pc&quot;-&quot;pc+$20&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also, due to making expressions support register names (and symbols), and
</I>&gt;<i> register names being similar to hexadecimal numbers, in expression all
</I>&gt;<i> hexadecimal numbers need to be prefixed with $ or 0x.  I.e. the number
</I>&gt;<i> base setting will work for hex only outside of expressions.
</I>
Well, not all.  One needs to add prefix only to hexadecimal numbers that
could be confused with registers (d0-7, a0-f7).  Let's hope that's not
a problem.


&gt;<i> [1] evaluate command doesn't need the quotes.  I could make dsp/address
</I>&gt;<i> command not to require them either and always evaluate the address
</I>&gt;<i> command argument, but this would mean that you would always need to use
</I>&gt;<i> $/0x for hex numbers which could be annoying...
</I>
Address breakpoints won't require quotes for evaluation.


&gt;<i> &gt; Note that parenthesis are used for precedence with the evaluated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; expressions, they cannot be used for indirection.  Parenthesis behaving
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; differently on expressions and conditional breakpoints could be a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; source of confusion, but I don't see anything that could be done for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any comments on these limitatations?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After this is done, I've thought to remove the &quot;value&quot; command.  Evaluate
</I>&gt;<i> can do the same, better.  Number base setting could be moved e.g. behind
</I>&gt;<i> setopt command (I think it's more logical there).
</I>
Done, &quot;value&quot; command is gone.


&gt;<i> Setopt could have also options for setting how many lines disasm and
</I>&gt;<i> memdump display by default.  Should they be separate for each?  What
</I>&gt;<i> about DSP v.s. CPU memdump &amp; disasm?
</I>
Any comments on these?


&gt;<i> &gt; Some other things I thought I could add/change:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Removing the current address breakpoint implementation and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; implementing them as shortcuts for conditional breakpoints.  With
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; symbol etc support it's getting too awkward to support two separate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; breakpoint
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   implementations (of which the address one needs more support for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   having it both for CPU and DSP).
</I>
Done, address breakpoint is now just an alias for conditional breakpoint. 
(adds &lt;100 LOC, removes &gt;300 LOC)

This is large change.  Please check that &quot;a&quot; &amp; &quot;da&quot; breakpoints still work
fine, I've tested them lightly.


From the usage point of view, the main differences are:

* Removing an &quot;a&quot; &amp; &quot;da&quot; address breakpoint needs to be done using
  conditional breakpoint command:  &quot;b &lt;index&gt;&quot; as it's not possible to
  identify conditional breakpoints by an address.  You see the breakpoint
  index when breakpoint is hit, so I don't think this is too much of
  an issue?

* Breakpoint options require now ':', but it supports &quot;:trace&quot; as they're
  now conditional breakpoints.

* DSP &quot;address breakpoints&quot; are now also counted
  (you can use &quot;:once&quot; or &quot;:&lt;count&gt;&quot;).

* You can give expressions as addresses (&quot;a a+$200&quot;).

* Breakpoints in previously saved memory states are invalid.
  (In long run it's better to save them separately, currently they're
  still in the memory state file)


&gt;<i> &gt; * Above change requires making the options in a way that makes then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; easier to locate from a command. I thought to use &quot;:&quot; for this.   Then
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the breakpoints would look like this:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	a $1234 : 4		# break on every fourth hit
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	b $ffaa ! $ffaa : trace	# trace changes to value in $ffaa
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	b pc &gt; pc : once	# break after e.g. loop exits
</I>
Done.


&gt;<i> &gt; * Adding &quot;lock&quot; option to the info command.  This option would make
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; debugger to show the given info subcommand result whenever the debugger
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is invoked. To make this more useful, I would add &quot;registers&quot;, &quot;disasm&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and &quot;memdump&quot; subcommands to &quot;info&quot; command.  Then to see a certain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; memory address whenever entering debugger (a breakpoint is hit etc),
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; one would use: info memdump $1234 : lock
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   And to switch back to currently shown stuff (CPU PC, VBL etc):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	info default : lock
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Done, with &quot;lock&quot; command.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * &quot;until (u)&quot; command to run until a certain condition happens:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	u pc &gt; pc
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   This would be just a shortcut for:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	b pc &gt; pc :once
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	cont
</I>
It's quite easy to do do shortcut wrappers for conditional breakpoints.
I won't implement them until there's been some discussion about what
would be most useful.  If you have any wishes for shortcuts, please mail!
