[cc'ing this to devel list, to keep track of the issue]

Hello,

I remember this game too, one of the very first one for monochrome screen, 
very fine gfx at this time.

I gave this one a (deep) look, and this is a very vicious problem.
In fact it seems that when TCDR is at 01 and is decremented (which will 
triger the interrupt) then TCDR is reloaded with $ff *before* the 
interrupt in $114 is called by the cpu (else, the routine in $114 takes 
approx 800 cycles, which is superior to the 652 cycles to decrement TCDR 
so it's impossible to read $ff after the RTE).

So, the only explanation is that fffa23 is read with $ff just before the 
68000 interrupt.

This goes in the same category as audio art by big alec and super hang on : 
the mfp is running asynchronously to the 68000 and there seems to be a 
delay when mfp data reg goes to 0 before the int request is sent to the 
68000 (in Hatari this is immediate, hence the problem). During this delay, 
the cpu has the time to run one instruction, which will allow to read 
$fffa23 with $ff.

One solution would be to delay all mfp ints to the next cpu instruction, 
but this might broke some demos that rely on very precise timings (but if 
it's how it works on real hardware, then it's the way to go anyway).

Marked on my todo list, I will try to write some code to measure this 
precisely on a real ST.

Regards

Nicolas
