<PRE>Hi,

On Saturday 13 March 2010, Thomas H. wrote:
&gt;<i> &gt; I'm mainly interested on comments on removal of the Zoom checkbox and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; replacing it with the &quot;Max doubled&quot; option that gives you more control
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; on what size TT &amp; Falcon resolutions come up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I gave it a quick try, and noticed a couple of things:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) As I described earlier already, I dislike the word &quot;doubling&quot; here,
</I>&gt;<i> since doubling only means scaling by factor 2. However, this does not
</I>&gt;<i> apply for all Falcon resolutions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2) &quot;Window&quot; is also somewhat misleading. Hatari runs also on systems that
</I>&gt;<i> do not have a window manager at all (e.g. Wii). I suggest to use &quot;Video&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> or &quot;Host screen&quot; or something similar instead.
</I>
Hm.  Should the &quot;Monitor&quot; dialog name to change too?
Then it would be &quot;Atari screen&quot; and &quot;Host screen&quot;.


&gt;<i> 3) The &quot;Max doubled&quot; resolution setting feels very unintuitive. It took
</I>&gt;<i> me a while till a figured out that I now have to increase the horizontal
</I>&gt;<i> resolution to 832 instead of 800 to enable zooming of ST low resolution
</I>&gt;<i> (with borders).
</I>
That of course depends on one's border values (and therefore I like your
suggestion later on).  The default max resolution values can be set so that
screen gets doubled also with max borders.


&gt;<i> The normal Hatari users likely do not now about the 
</I>&gt;<i> resolution of the emulated system, so I guess they will be _very_
</I>&gt;<i> confused when they try to enable or disable the  zooming now. I suggest
</I>&gt;<i> to add the &quot;Zoom low resolution&quot; checkbox again to avoid this confusing
</I>&gt;<i> situation.
</I>
How it should work UI wise?  Use of that conflicts with specifying the size
of resolution.

And if the resolution of whatever the &quot;Zoom low resolution&quot; uses, isn't
suitable for the user, that's even worse.  One of the reasons for being able
to specify the resolution is making sure that it will fit suitably to users'
screen[1].  I.e. user can put there his screen size and Hatari adopts to
that.

[1] Therefore I made max resolution to have more priority than borders
setting (and user gets a dialog when it doesn't fit).


&gt;<i> Another idea: Instead of using &quot;Max doubled&quot; resolution setting, you
</I>&gt;<i> could rename it to &quot;Preferred resolution&quot;
</I>
The problem with that name is that user isn't going to get his preferred
resolution:
- Falcon/TT resolution have only integer scaling factor
- ST/STE resolution only doubles

So I'd rather keep the &quot;Max&quot; in the name...


&gt;<i> or so, and then for ST/STE mode, you could use it to configure
</I>&gt;<i> the border sizes in zoomed mode instead  (i.e. the nWindowBorderPixels
</I>&gt;<i> and nFullScreenBorderPixels settings). 
</I>&gt;<i> What do you think? 
</I>
That sounds better, but if border size is taken from Max size, what should
them be done about the border pixels settings?

Remove them?  Use them as maximum border values?

I guess, unlike now, doubling will then have more priority over having
borders?  I mean, if user specifies 640x400 as max resoution, he would get
doubled low res without borders...
