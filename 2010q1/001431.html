Well sorry I am not familiar with programming C and even less using SDL. 
And further on Cmake is not a part of Xcode, hence no such command found.

We are speaking two different things here. First it was about screen 
garbage/wrong colours etc when jumping in/out of fullscreen - that's what 
the screenshots are from.

The too low resolution (or resolution change at all) is another thing.



&gt;<i> I don't see how it would not be a bug in the application.  Are all OSX apps
</I>&gt;<i> as broken when it comes to their window management, or is this misfeature
</I>&gt;<i> specific to Photoshop?
</I>
I tried today to do resolution change with the OS, Photshop behaves well, 
it adapts fine to the new screen mode. I tested the Vice emulator, 
works fine coming from fullscreen as well. I used VMWare in 
fullscreen, no problems there either. However, for Hatari coming back 
from fullscreen Photoshop still belives the resolution is 800x600 and the 
toolbars are locked into the confied area. Totally unusable. Photoshop 
CS3.



&gt;<i> I do have a couple of (mobile) devices with LCD screens, but Hatari doesn't
</I>&gt;<i> have on them the problem you describe either.  They claim to support
</I>&gt;<i> only resolution(s) that they support properly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Btw. those devices display HW has a good scaling algorithm.  It's used e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> for fullscreen video playback through the XVideo API.
</I>
Of course my LCD screens have &quot;good scaling algorithms&quot; but it's 
interpolated scaling - it looks well on movies and images, but 
not for pixel graphics which should have sharp edges not interpolated 
such.


Anyway I give up, Hatari is perfect.
