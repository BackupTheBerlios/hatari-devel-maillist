Google tells that CMake provides binaries for OSX:

Is the resolution same as it was initially?  Others using Hatari on OSX
don't seem to be having the same problem as you.

</I>
I still don't understand.  How do you expect Hatari to be able to do
the scaling better?


&gt;<i> Anyway I give up, Hatari is perfect.
</I>
Hatari has many things that could be better, but if nobody else can 
reproduce the issue you have, even on OSX, that at least indicates that
the issue is in your environment (besides meaning that it's impossible to
fix the issue without help from you).
