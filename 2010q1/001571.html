<PRE>Hi,

My list for debugger:

* Testing the new debugger features &amp; changes more and fixing any found
  issues (Laurent has already reported several ones I've recently fixed)

* Adding a debugger section to config file which has:
  - number base (moved from log section)
  - disasm &amp; memdump default number of lines settings

* Removing breakpoints from the memory state.  Breakpoints and other
  debugger commands can be done at startup by giving a debugger
  commands file with the new  --parse command line option (which still
  needs to be documented).

* Possibly add some debugger additional convenience functions
  using conditional breakpoints (see todo.txt for possible ones).
  Any suggestions on what you'd like to have?


&gt;<i> &gt;   - ste's screen centering in 224 bytes overscan (nicolas)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   - mfp delay (bolo, audio art, super hang on) (nicolas)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   - clean makefiles in case some files are redundant with cmake (eero,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     thomas ?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've removed the autoconf files already, and Eero wants to maintain the
</I>&gt;<i> old Makefiles, so we're in a good shape here already, as far as I can
</I>&gt;<i> tell.
</I>
Yep, that should be OK.


&gt;<i> I just got to fix one or two issues in the CMake build system for &quot;make
</I>&gt;<i> install&quot;, but I think I can do this before April...
</I>
Thomas, do you have check for &lt;sys/times.h&gt; (-&gt; HAVE_SYS_TIMES_H)?


&gt;<i> &gt;   - clean/fix some possible remaining issues in dsp/dma (I think lmc
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; as used in STE for volume control will not make it for 1.4) (laurent)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   - X/Y scaling patch by eero ; I didn't really test this, it seems
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; some tests would be needed against a real falcon ?
</I>
Yes, but from from Thomas' last comment I think it would be fine.

There are actually several things:

* Window scaling according to the VIDEL Video Mode control register.

* Fixing hostscreen fullscreen switching for the case when SDL fullscreen
   toggling doesn't work (i.e. keep track of requested Atari screen size and
   don't just use the SDL window's fullscreen resolution for the windowed
   mode.

* User being able to specify what's the maximum doubled/zoomed screen size.

* Splitting the Screen dialog (as above setting doesn't fit into
  current one) into separate Monitor and Window settings dialogs.


&gt;<i> &gt; Any others ideas are welcome !
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We should take care of this bug here:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I><A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=16851&amp;group_id=10436">http://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?func=detailbug&amp;bug_id=16851&amp;group_id=10436</A>

Adding libm to libs is fine from my point, but that's listed in the bug just
as an example.  Does somebody have a new Fedora (I'm running Debian) or
virtual machine with one who could try building Hatari and see whether there
are any other libs that need to be explicitly linked from Hatari?

After that I we know what to actually add to CMake &amp; Makefile.cnf.
