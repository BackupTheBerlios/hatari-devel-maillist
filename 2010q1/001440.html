Yes the resolution comes back to what it was initially. A wild guess is 
that perhaps not that many uses Photoshop and Hatari side-by-side.

By doing a scaling without interpolation.

Here's an image that compares nearest neighbour and bilinear filtering of 
the ST desktop. I hope you can tell the difference now.

A modern screen will apply filtering, which looks fine for images and 
movies, but for lowres oldskool graphics, not.

I have four machines with OS X, and all behave the same.

Macbook Pro C2D 2.2, GF8600, 1440x900, OSX 10.6
Macbook Pro C2D 2.4, GF9600, 1920x1200, OSX 10.6
Mac Mini C2D 1.83, GMA950, 1920x1080, OSX 10.6
Macbook CD 2.0, GMA950, 1280x800, OSX 10.5

As you can see, two CPU types, four differnt resolutions with both 16:10 
and 16:9 aspect ratios, two OS versions and three different GPU's.
