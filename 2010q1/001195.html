 Hi all!

As you might have already seen in the repository, I recently started to
add CMake build files to Hatari. Now I think it's stable enough so that
everybody could have a try.

First of all, why a new build system? Wasn't the old Makefile-based
built system working well enough? Well, it was most of the time, but it
also had a lot of problems:

- The autoconf/configure way vs. Makefile-default.cnf:
  I think most developers simply used the Makefile-default.cnf setup
  without taking care of configure.ac - quite understandable, since
  editing configure.ac requires knowledge about the autoconf &quot;madness&quot;,
  you have to struggle with M4 and portable shell script programming,
  and that's no fun at all.
  However, most users are used to run &quot;./configure ; make ; make
  install&quot; to install a software (and actually also complain if there
  is no configure script, I had this situation in the past...), and the
  configure step is also required for compiling on most non-Linux
  systems.
  So we had the situation that developers and users use different steps
  to configure and compile the emulator ... not a very good solution
  since the configure script often dropped behind the
  Makefile-default.cnf evolvement.

- Managing dependencies between header files and C files is quite a
  pain and very error prone with pure Makefiles. It's working most of
  the time in Hatari now, thanks to the &quot;make depend&quot; target, but there
  are still situations where people complain an the mailing list that
  Hatari does not compile anymore - and we've got to tell them that a
  simply &quot;make distclean&quot; inbetween should fix the issue.

- Our Makefiles only worked with GNU-Make, other derivates like
  BSD-make did not work.

- Our build system did not support out-of-source builds (i.e.
  generating the object files out of the source tree), which is helpful
  for cross-compiling and distributors.

- The Mac OS X build system is a separate build system. It
  does not get updated automatically when we add or remove a a
  .c file in the main Makefiles. So OS X users often complain
  about the non-working Xcode files.

- Some people tried to compile Hatari on Windows with an IDE, without
  using the Makefiles, for example with Code::Blocks or Visual Studio.
  Most of them failed, being quite frustrated afterwards. I think we
  could get a lot of more support from these users when we enabled
  Hatari build for these IDEs, too.

After being quite frustrated of this situation for quite a while, I
recently came across CMake: <A HREF="http://www.cmake.org/">http://www.cmake.org/</A>
CMake is a build system configuration environment, somewhat similar to
what autoconf provides, but with multiple backends and much easier to
use than autoconf:

- It can generate Makefiles for make, project files for Visual Studio,
  Code::Blocks and XCode.

- It supports library and header file detection (similar to autoconf)

- The Makefiles that CMake generates are really cool, they use colored
  output, percentage indicator, proper header &lt;-&gt; .c file
  dependencies, out-of-source builds, etc.

- The syntax of the CMakeList.txt files is likely new to everybody, but
  it is very easy to learn. I've never run into big problems here, and
  the cmake manual is quite helpful (and not as chaotic as the various
  autotools info-pages)

All in all, it solves most of the problems that I've mentioned above.

Now, I'd like to ask you to try it out, so we can discuss here on the
mailing list whether we should switch complete to CMake or stay with
the old build system.
For testing it, please install &quot;cmake&quot;, create an empty folder
somewhere and run cmake from there with the path to the sources as
argument. For example, if you are at the top of the sources:

  mkdir obj
  cd obj
  cmake ..

(you could also run &quot;cmake .&quot; from the top of the sources, but this
would currently overwrite the old Makefiles, which is certainly not
what you want)
It should configure the build process and generate Makefiles. Then you
can run &quot;make&quot; (and &quot;make install&quot;) to build Hatari.
Then please have a look at the CMakeLists.txt files to see whether you
like the CMake syntax or not (and compare it to configure.ac ;-) )

What do you think about it?

 Regards,
  Thomas


PS: I haven't tried cmake on Mac OS X or Windows yet, so it might not
work there yet.
