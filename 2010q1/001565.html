I discussed this with thomas at one time, and march seemed a good date to 
try to do a release.

It might be a little early for me now, as there're a few things with 
video/mfp I'd like to sort, but maybe we could try to target mid-april 
(I'd also like to build a cross compiler chain under my linux box to be 
able to compile windows binaries without having to boot under windows ; 
adding a mingw-under-linux target to cmake would be nice too).

So, what is everyone's list of things to finish in the next weeks ? Here's 
a short list to start :

  - ste's screen centering in 224 bytes overscan (nicolas)
  - mfp delay (bolo, audio art, super hang on) (nicolas)
  - clean makefiles in case some files are redundant with cmake (eero,
    thomas ?)
  - clean/fix some possible remaining issues in dsp/dma (I think lmc as
    used in STE for volume control will not make it for 1.4) (laurent)
  - X/Y scaling patch by eero ; I didn't really test this, it seems some
    tests would be needed against a real falcon ?
  - ...

Any others ideas are welcome !


Nicolas
