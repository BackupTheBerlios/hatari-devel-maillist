Sorry, but this will only cause confusion. If we announce mic input
support on the one hand, and then let the user run into this
oh-by-the-way-the-autoconf-build-system-does-not-support-portaudio
problem ... no, that's not a good idea.

&gt;<i> CMake is getting popular, but it's not necessarily yet on all
</I>&gt;<i> platforms on which Hatari is currently being build (BSD?  Wii?
</I>&gt;<i> Maemo?  Amiga?).
</I>
It's certainly available on BSD and other unix-style operating systems.
Concerning Wii, Amiga and the other exotic systems... I don't think that
they were really using autoconf, but rather edited Makefile.cnf
directly (and I didn't talk about removing the old Makefiles yet).

&gt;<i> &gt; and the old Xcode project will be broken again as soon as we 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; introduce a new file or rename an existing file.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Was configure.ac used also for Xcode stuff?
</I>
No, see Hatari.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj - it's an ugly file created by
the IDE, which also differs a little bit from Xcode version to the
other, so it's also ugly to maintain this file in a versioning system.

&gt;<i> &gt; I do not want to update this stuff anymore, do you?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Me neither, but I don't see any problem in keeping it still around for
</I>&gt;<i> a while, while it works OK.
</I>
Do you know whether the configure.ac is still working at all? Have you
tried recently? At least I haven't tried it since the last release...

So for keeping this file, I suggest that somebody volunteers to take over
the maintainance. If nobody volunteers, I'll remove it at the next weekend.
