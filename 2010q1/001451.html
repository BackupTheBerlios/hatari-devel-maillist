Look, the monitors have their own hardware based scaling. It's not a 
setting in the OS or so. A modern monitor does use interpolation as it 
make the stuff normal users are doing look pretty well, eg photos and 
videos.

Where did I say this? I've been using 1.3.1 since it was released. The 
development versions (which a friend compiles now and then) have bugs that 
makes it unusuable for coding demos, but I know Styckx is working on that 
(have to do with fullscreen and hardware scrolling on STe).
