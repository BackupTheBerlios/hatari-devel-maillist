I've commited a fix for this issue.

I also commited preliminary support for Falcon/TT Monitor aspect ratio
correction (similar to ST-medrez vertical doubling).  It also skips SDL
video mode setting when not needed (res, bpp etc are same).

For issues in this to be found easier, I disabled the old/incorrect 
Falcon/TT rez zooming that was in hostscreen.c.


My plan is next to (as there were no comments against
the dialog split when I earlier sent the patch):

1. Split Monitor and Window configuration to  separate dialogs in Hatari
    options

2. Remove old &quot;Zoom low rez&quot; option

3. Add an option for &quot;Max doubled size&quot; Window dialog which will increase
   the size of Falcon or TT resolutions by an integer scaling factor that
   provides closest (but smaller) resolution than the specified max
   resolution.

   Although it may use scaling factor larger than 2, I'll call it &quot;doubling&quot;
   to make it clear that it uses an integer scaling factor. Zooming gives
   IMHO false expectation by implying something that would match
   the selected max resolution exactly (but if you have better name
   for this option, I'm all ears! :-))....

4. Add an option for &quot;Keep aspect ratio&quot; to the Monitor dialog.
   Disabling this will disable both ST-medrez vertical doubling and
   ST-lowerez doubling in addition to Falcon modes horizontal &amp;
   vertical doubling.  Aspect ratio correction will be done only if
   it also keeps below given &quot;Max doubled size&quot;.

Most of 1-3 was in the patch I've sent earlier, it just needs an update
+ &quot;Keep aspect ratio&quot; functionality.
