Yes, on linux we can add some &quot;modeline&quot; lines into xorg.conf, but if 
your monitor is 1920x1024, not doing any scaling and adding some black 
borders will certainly give some crisp pixels, but a very small display 
area, and a rather poor user experience in the end.

And I'm not sure it will solve possible problems under windows or osx, 
where the SDL port can be the cause of some limitation (due to lack of 
interest/maintenance) we don't see under linux.

&gt;<i> Even SDL itself may offer this, I haven't looked into it.

Don't know either.

&gt;<i> This will require support both from video.c and falcon/hostscreen.c and
</I>&gt;<i> rewrite of at least the hostscreen.c fullscreen toggling function (but
</I>&gt;<i> latter should apparently anyway be rewritten).
</I>
Why ? I thought doing it screen.c would be enough. On the contrary, I 
think this should be independant to the processing done in 
video.c/hostscreen.c ; some modifications could be made to toggle 
fullscreen in a more generic way but this should mainly call a function in 
screen.c

video.c has no idea of what display size is used : it &quot;outputs&quot; some 
pixels in Atari's format (interlaced planar) and the screen.c/convert.c 
transform these pixels into an SDL_Surface &quot;sdlscrn&quot;.

We would just need to optionnally transform sdlscrn into sdlscrn2 and 
display sdlscrn2 instead of sdlscrn for this to work.
