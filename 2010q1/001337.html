<PRE>Hi,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; with a built in window system,

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Things could even be shown on specific parts of the screen if Hatari
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dependency to ncurses is OK, but that could constrict the area for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; other outputs (help texts etc) and require changing a lot of code, so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'd skip that, at least for now.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (I think that kind of stuff would be a better in a separate GUI
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; debugger that works over the Hatari control socket.)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; register locking,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hatari debugger already supports showing different kinds of invormation
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; when entering the debugger.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; And what's shown when entering the debugger could be configurable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (regs, memdump, disassembly, for CPU and/or DSP).  It could be based on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the register values too (address in register N).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The hard part isn't in implementing that, but getting a good syntax on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; how to specify it to the debugger...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; search  in disasm mode, ...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Byte search could also be implemented.  With an option for using word
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; boundary for searching instruction opcodes.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Doing it based on using assembler instructions (instead of opcodes)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; like is possible in Monst would probably be too complicated though,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unless somebody wants to write the lookup tables needed for this...
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; I really used a lot of this some years ago and I don't see how adding
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; symbol to hatari debugger would make it much useful than debugging
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; directly under the emulated atari, there so much power in monst that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; making Hatari at the same level would be a huge task.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; After digging my Devpac manual from the attic, I went through it and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; checked what other features Hatari debugger is currently missing in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; addition to above listed ones:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 1. Showing PC and breakpoints positions in the disassembly output.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    -&gt; easy at least for PC and address breakpoints
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 2. Counting breakpoints.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 3. Stopping at breakpoint only after it's been passed certain number
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    of times.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    -&gt; 2) &amp; 3) are trivial to do too, but need to be done separately
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;         for CPU, DSP and conditional breakpoints
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 4. Breakpoints that act only once (and disappears after a hit?)
</I>
I just commited the first four features for CPU address breakpoints.

Note: that if you have no _address_ breakpoints, symbols aren't shown
in the CPU disassembly trace either.


Usage:
* Set a breakpoint that is deleted before it drops you to debugger:
	address &lt;address&gt; 1
* Set a breakpoint that triggers only on each fourth hit:
	address &lt;address&gt; 4


Laurent, would you be interested about counted breakpoints for DSP?


&gt;<i> &gt; 5. Shortcut for telling to run until given (temporary breakpoint)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     condition is hit.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    -&gt; Would be trivial to do after 4)
</I>
Only if 4) would be implemented for conditional breakpoints...


&gt;<i> &gt; 6. Running until code returns from ROM (exiting from super mode?)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 7. Single stepping that skips Traps, Line-A, Line-F. And one that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;     skips also BSRs and JSRs.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 8. Set breakpoint to next instruction and run (to skip loops)
</I>
With feature 4), this would be easy to do too.  Anybody want a &quot;next&quot;
command?


&gt;<i> &gt; 9. Set breakpoint on specific OS call
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 10. Run slowly
</I>
&quot;slow &lt;msecs to sleep between instructions&gt;&quot;?


&gt;<i> &gt; 11. Showing contents of memory pointed by the registers
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 12. Saving machine status to history buffer each time debugger is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       entered (exception or breakpoint is hit) and being able to view
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;       this history
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 13. SP &amp; SSP as CPU register names (active &amp; supervisor stack)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 13. Fill and copy memory
</I>
&quot;fill &lt;range&gt; &lt;value&gt;&quot;, &quot;copy &lt;range&gt; &lt;address&gt;&quot;?


&gt;<i> &gt; Although all together these are quite a lot of added code and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complexity, each individual feature is pretty easy to do.  Which of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; them you would prioritize?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (The hard thing would again be what kind of a syntax one would use for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; specifying them to Hatari...)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Btw. Monst manual mentioned couple of things that could be nice in
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hatari debugger.  For example:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Running until code gets out of ROM:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	SP = A7
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; * Running until subroutine ends (RTS=0x4e75):
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 	(PC).w = 0x4e75  &amp;&amp;  SP &gt; CURRENT_SP_MINUS_ONE
</I>
Please prioritize, what's most useful for you?

(I do very little instruction level debugging myself...)


Btw. I think soon the debugger needs to split the help output to sections
like the Hatari command line options help does...
