Ok, that sounds reasonable.

</I>&gt;<i>         message(STATUS &quot;WARNING: Python not present, hatariui cannot

</I>&gt;<i> endif(PYTHONINTERP_FOUND)
</I>
Well, I think that could also be annoying for people who do not need
the the python-ui and don't have python installed (e.g. on Windows).
So let's keep it simple, without warning message.

&gt;<i> /hatari/src/file.c: In function &#8216;File_Read&#8217;:
</I>&gt;<i> /hatari/src/file.c:193: warning: implicit declaration of function

</I>&gt;<i> /hatari/src/file.c: In function &#8216;File_Save&#8217;:
</I>&gt;<i> /hatari/src/file.c:268: warning: assignment makes pointer from
</I>&gt;<i> integer without a cast
</I>
This is certainly caused by the fact that the CMakeLists.txt in the
topmost directory turns on large filesystem support via &quot;getconf
LFS_CFLAGS&quot; - which is not done by the old Makefiles.
But you should not get warning messages because of this - unless your
zlib.h is broken. My zlib.h looks like this here:

#if defined(_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE) || _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64
   ZEXTERN gzFile ZEXPORT gzopen64 OF((const char *, const char *));
   ZEXTERN z_off64_t ZEXPORT gzseek64 OF((gzFile, z_off64_t, int));
   ZEXTERN z_off64_t ZEXPORT gztell64 OF((gzFile));
   ZEXTERN uLong ZEXPORT adler32_combine64 OF((uLong, uLong, z_off64_t));
   ZEXTERN uLong ZEXPORT crc32_combine64 OF((uLong, uLong, z_off64_t));
#endif

#if _FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64
#  define gzopen gzopen64
#  define gzseek gzseek64
#  define gztell gztell64
#  define adler32_combine adler32_combine64
#  define crc32_combine crc32_combine64
#else
...
#endif

That means it does both, declaring the right prototypes and then
re-defining the functions to the 64-bit versions.
What is your zlib.h doing?

&gt;<i> For example isblank() manual page says:
</I>&gt;<i>    Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
</I>&gt;<i> feature_test_macros(7)): isascii(): _BSD_SOURCE || _SVID_SOURCE ||
</I>&gt;<i> _XOPEN_SOURCE isblank(): _XOPEN_SOURCE &gt;= 600 || _ISOC99_SOURCE; or
</I>&gt;<i> cc -std=c99
</I>
That's interesting... but I can't see how CMake could cause that
warning. Could you check the corresponding header file in which case
it defines isblank() and in which case is does not?


&gt;<i> When I ran ccmake (cmake ncurses UI) and switched it to advanced mode,
</I>&gt;<i> I noticed that it at least turns assert()s off by default.
</I>
You've got to tell CMake to generate a debug build (set
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to Debug), then it will keep the asserts enabled.
When you specify nothing, it will create a Release build - which has
asserts turned off.

&gt;<i> CMake defines SDL_LIBRARY
</I>&gt;<i> as: /usr/lib/libSDLmain.a;/usr/lib/libSDL.so;-lpt
</I>
This is done by the standard FindSDL.cmake package that is shipped with
CMake. I think they now what they're doing. If not, they would probably
get a lot of complaints on their mailing lists... ;-)

&gt;<i> Eventually build with CMake fails with:
</I>&gt;<i> make[2]: *** No rule to make target `../doc/hatari.1.gz', needed by 
</I>&gt;<i> `doc/CMakeFiles/manpages'.  Stop.
</I>&gt;<i> make[1]: *** [doc/CMakeFiles/manpages.dir/all] Error 2
</I>&gt;<i> make: *** [all] Error 2
</I>
Huh? Strange, this works for me, and I can't see any obvious problem in
doc/CMakeLists.txt ... which version of CMake are you using?

&gt;<i> PS. In general CMake seems nice and it seems to have pretty extensive
</I>&gt;<i> documentation in its the Debian package.
</I>
Yes, documentation is really good and also looks much better to me than
the docs for the autoconf stuff... that's also one of the many reasons I
was finally pushing for CMake instead of autoconf ;-)
