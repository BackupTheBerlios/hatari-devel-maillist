<PRE>Hi,

</I>
&quot;b ($FF82C2).w ! ($FF82C2).w :trace&quot;  on this gives:

Startup situation:
  $ff82c2 = $0

In the tunnel screen:
  $ff82c2 = $1

And after this the demo on some screens toggles this bit.

This is the line doubling bit.  The screen size is 320x100 without Hatari
zooming.  Shouldn't line doubling bit automatically double the *vertical*
resolution like is done for the ST-med interlace?

(And then screen zooming doubling both directions is the correct thing to
do as that maintains the correct aspect ratio.)


Could you please check/answer this (see below).  What's the right thing to
do to Falcon resolution / window size emulation?

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On Hatari VGA monitor emu:
</I>&gt;<i> - On the 320x200 default res, the Half pixel width bit 2 and
</I>&gt;<i>   Line doubling bit 0 are both set (TOS4 says &quot;line doubling=on).
</I>&gt;<i> - Changing from 40  to 80 columns mode clears the Half pixel width bit 2
</I>&gt;<i>   and sets the Quarter pixel bit 3.  Vertical resolution increases from
</I>&gt;<i>  200 to 480, more than double (interlace doubled the res exactly).  Why?
</I>&gt;<i> - Changing line doubling to off, clears bit 0.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, I can catch them.   But should Hatari really double vertical and
</I>&gt;<i> horizontal resolution differently when some of these bits are set, and
</I>&gt;<i> if yes, for which of them?
</I>
If the window size should be doubled in some direction like is done with
the ST medrez, Videl code could tell that to the hostscreen stuff based
on this register's values.

I just want to know what kind of zoom factors should be automatically used
when these bits are set.

(The user zooming/doubling setting is then a separate thing to do after
this.)


&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; Attached is a patch that makes the desired target window resolution
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; selectable from the configuration file.  If resolution would still
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &gt; fit to that size when doubled, it will be doubled in both directions.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any comments on the patch?  Only thing missing from it is the GUI
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code for letting user to specify the target/max window size for
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doubling and having a command line option for that + doc updates.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It will prevent Hatari from trying to use a resolution (e.g.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; borders+doubling) that can be larger than what user wants it to use.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Attached is a new patch and screenshots of the Screen dialog which
</I>&gt;<i> I split in the patch into separate (Atari) Monitor and (Hatari) Window
</I>&gt;<i> dialogs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The window dialog has user configurable Max size for doubled resolutions
</I>&gt;<i> (doubling won't be used if it would make window larger in either
</I>&gt;<i> direction than the given max size).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Enabling doubling means now just that you specify your screen resolution,
</I>&gt;<i> or leave it at default values (800x600) if you don't have a larger
</I>&gt;<i> monitor or don't want larger Falcon resolutions to be scaled too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you want to temparily disable doubling completely, that will now be
</I>&gt;<i> more awkward (one needs to set the max resolution low enough that screen
</I>&gt;<i> will be never doubled), but is that really a problem?
</I>

PS.  Sometimes I get this infinitely from TYS:
	Dsp: 0x0010: 0x00007f unknown instruction

-&gt; Something gotten broken in DSP emulation after v1.3.1?
